  abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have made a qualitative leap and effected a real revolution in knowledge representation. This is leveraged by the underlying structure of the KG which underpins a better comprehension, reasoning and interpretation of knowledge for both human and machine. Therefore, KGs continue to be used as the main means of tackling a plethora of real-life problems in various domains. However, there is no consensus in regard to a plausible and inclusive definition of a domain-specific KG. Further, in conjunction with several limitations and deficiencies, various domain-specific KG construction approaches are far from perfect. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive definition of a domain-specific KG. Also, the paper presents a thorough review of the state-of-the-art approaches drawn from academic works relevant to seven domains of knowledge. An examination of current approaches reveals a range of limitations and deficiencies. At the same time, uncharted territories on the research map are highlighted to tackle extant issues in the literature and point to directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, the Mediterranean Sea has been for millennia the place where religions, economies, and political systems met, clashed, influenced and absorbed one another. In this brilliant and expansive book, David Abulafia offers a fresh perspective by focusing on the sea itself: its practical importance for transport and sustenance; its dynamic role in the rise and fall of empires; and the remarkable cast of characters-sailors, merchants, migrants, pirates, pilgrims-who have crossed and re-crossed it.  Ranging from prehistory to the 21st century, The Great Sea is above all a history of human interaction. Interweaving major political and naval developments with the ebb and flow of trade, Abulafia explores how commercial competition in the Mediterranean created both rivalries and partnerships, with merchants acting as intermediaries between cultures, trading goods that were as exotic on one side of the sea as they were commonplace on the other. He stresses the remarkable ability of Mediterranean cultures to uphold the civilizing ideal of convivencia, "living together."  Now available in paperback, The Great Sea is the definitive account of perhaps the most vibrant theater of human interaction in history.},

The volume will also provide an impression of how this material has been read and interpreted in various contexts and historical periods. The authors engage the topic from a variety of approaches, asking historical, literary, theological, and feminist questions (among others) about wisdom literature. The essays offer detailed and thorough studies of the relevant texts and also discuss a number of issues that are pertinent to the study of wisdom literature, such as the figure of Solomon, pedagogy in the ancient world, and the oral transmission of sayings. While many of the essays focus on antiquity and the context in which wisdom literature was produced, the contributors deal with later periods as well, including our own context, as in, for example, the essay by Rindge on sapiential themes in contemporary cinema. The cultural contexts that the contributors take into consideration include both the ancient world, as in the essays by Adams and Samet on, respectively, Egypt and Mesopotamia, and also settings that are traditionally not prominent in the study of wisdom literature, such as the essay by Masenya, which compares the book of Proverbs to didactic and gnomic traditions in Africa"--},

Computational methods to ontology analysis may provide a semantic flavor to data analysis of biomedical mathematical models and help discover hidden links.

We define an OWL sublanguage - L and we present a methodology for transformation of L ontologies into directed labelled graphs. We then show how Social Network Analysis techniques (e.g., centrality measures, graph partitioning, community detection) can be used to i) filter the information presented to the user, and ii) provide a summary of knowledge encoded in the ontology. Finally, we show the application of ontology exploration in the biomedical domain to help discover hidden links between the biomedical datasets.},

  abstract = {Ancient states and early complex societies emerged in areas where urban settlements had the resources to house large populations and where economic and political centers and institutions could be established to run the society. By contrast, marshes, isolated deserts, extreme mountain peaks and thick forests served as refuges for those who wanted to escape from the state. Moreover, taking these examples into consideration, scholars seem to share the assumption that it is unexpected to find urban centers and central political organizations of isolated refuge areas in the ancient world. This dissertation examines the hypothesis that under certain historical and environmental circumstances, the marshes of southern Iraq, which are normally considered places of refuge, could become centers of political power and develop a political organization independent of that associated with irrigated areas. The focus of this dissertation will be on the archaeological evidence for an example of political independence in the marshes during the first Sealand dynasty (1739 -1340 BCE). Specifically, the objective is to understand how the archaeological record reflects the existence of this dynasty, and helps explain its success in these exceptional conditions.  The data will also help us to understand the archaeology of the Sealand during this time of political centralization in the southern Mesopotamian marshes. To date, all information concerning this dynasty has been based on textual sources unsupported by archaeological data.  From 2003 to 2009, I conducted surveys in both the alluvial plain and also the marshes of southern Iraq. The data I collected during that time will test the hypothesis that the people of Mesopotamia's ancient marshes exploited specific political and economic circumstances, through the use of their unique environmental setting, to create their own independent political structure, the first Sealand Dynasty. It will further test the idea that this dynasty took on the shape of a shadow state that confronted the primary state in Babylon.},

Thanks to a number of inscribed bricks it can securely be identified as ``E-Ibbi-Anum'', the temple of Dilbat's city god Ura{\v s}, which confirms earlier attempts to identify the site with that city. The Sumerian text of the inscriptions allows a secure dating of the building to the Kassite period, more precisely, the reign of a king named Kurigalzu (probably I).               1},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the use of digital tools~-- in particular, language technology~-- to study the history of emotions. There are a growing number of annotated text corpora for ancient languages large enough to benefit from computational analysis. This chapter focuses on the cuneiform Akkadian texts available in the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc) and applies two language-technological methods, pointwise mutual information (PMI) and the fastText implementation of the continuous skip-gram model, to a dataset of 7,346 texts. To illustrate the potential of these methods, they are used to analyze the semantic domains of the verb r{\^a}mu, ``to love,'' and its derivatives in Akkadian. Because the usage and semantic domains of a word can vary greatly between different genres, the dataset is divided into several genres, and the analysis focuses on royal inscriptions, letters, and literary text genres. The results show that, like the word love in English, r{\^a}mu can denote different aspects of affection and love. It refers, for example, to erotic and sexual relationships between people, affection between family members, the king's love of justice, and the gods' pleasure with and acceptance of the king who fulfills divine expectations.},

  abstract = {The trade in antiquities and cultural objects has proven difficult to understand and yet is highly dynamic. Currently, there are few computational tools that allow researchers to systematically understand the nature of the legal market, which can also potentially provide insights into the illegal market such as types of objects traded and countries trading antiquities. Online sales in antiquities and cultural objects are often unstructured data; relevant cultural affiliations, types, and materials for objects are important for distinguishing what might sell, but these data are rarely organized in a format that makes the quantification of sales a simple process. Additionally, sale locations and the total value of sales are relevant to understanding the focus and size of the market. These data all provide potentially useful insights into how the market in antiquities and cultural objects is developing. Based on this, this work presents the results of a machine learning approach using natural language processing and dictionary-based searches that investigate relatively low-end but high sales volume objects sold on eBay's U.S. site, where sales are often international, between October 2018 and May 2019. The use of named entity recognition, using a conditional random field approach, classifies objects based on the cultures in which they come from, what type of objects they are, and what the objects are made of. The results indicate that objects from the United Kingdom, affiliated with the Roman period, mostly constituting jewelry, and made of metals sell the most. Metal and jewelry objects, in fact, sold more than other object types. Other important countries for selling ancient and cultural objects include the United States, Thailand, Germany, and Cyprus. Some countries appear to more greatly sellspecific types of objects, such as Egypt being a leader in selling Islamic, terracotta, stone, and wood artifacts and Germany selling Viking/early Medieval weapons. Overall, the approach and tool used demonstrate that it is possible to monitor the online antiquities and cultural objects market while potentially gaining useful insights into the market. The tool developed is provided as part of this work so that it can be applied for other cases and online sites, where it can be applied in real time or using historical data.},

  abstract = {Recent fieldwork and archival sedimentary materials from southern Iraq have revealed new insights into the environment that shaped southern Mesopotamia from the pre-Ubaid (early Holocene) until the early Islamic period. These data have been combined with northern Iraqi speleothem, or stalagmite, data that have revealed relevant palaeoclimate information. The new results are investigated in light of textual sources and satellite remote sensing work. It is evident that areas south of Baghdad, and to the region of Uruk, were already potentially habitable between the eleventh and early eighth millennia B.C., suggesting there were settlements in southern Iraq prior to the Ubaid. Date palms, the earliest recorded for Iraq, are evident before 10,000 B.C., and oak trees are evident south of Baghdad in the early Holocene but disappeared after the mid-sixth millennium B.C. New climate results suggest increased aridity after the end of the fourth millennium B.C. For the third millennium B.C. to first millennium A.D., a negative relationship between grain and date palm cultivation in Nippur is evident, suggesting shifting cultivation emphasising one of these crops at any given time in parts of the city. The Shatt en-Nil was also likely used as a channel for most of Nippur's historical occupation from the third millennium B.C. to the first millennium A.D. In the early to mid-first millennium A.D., around the time of the Sasanian period, a major increase in irrigation is evident in plant remains, likely reflecting large-scale irrigation expansion in the Nippur region. The first millennium B.C. to first millennium A.D. reflects a relatively dry period with periodic increased rainfall. Sedimentary results suggest the Nahrawan, prior to it becoming a well-known canal, formed an ancient branch of the Tigris, while the region just south of Baghdad, around Dalmaj, was near or part of an ancient confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates.},

It shows how Cyrus' army was assembled covertly and led from the coast of Asia Minor all the way to Babylon; how the Greeks held the field against a superior Persian force; how Cyrus was killed, leaving the Greeks stranded deep within enemy territory; and how many of them overcame countless dangers and found their way back to Greece. Their remarkable success was due especially to the wily and decisive leadership of Xenophon himself, a student of Socrates who had joined the Ten Thousand and, after most of the Greek generals had been murdered, rallied the despondent Greeks, won a position of leadership, and guided them wisely through myriad obstacles. In this new translation of the Anabasis , Wayne Ambler achieves a masterful combination of liveliness and a fidelity to the original uncommon in other versions. Accompanying Ambler's translation is a penetrating interpretive essay by Eric Buzzetti, one that shows Xenophon to be an author who wove a philosophic narrative into his dramatic tale. The translation and interpretive essay encourage renewed study of the Anabasis as a work of political philosophy. They also celebrate its high adventure and its hero's adroit decision-making under the most pressing circumstances.},

Until recently, this progress has been fueled mostly by advances in machine learning; however, more and more researchers are realizing the importance of studying users of these systems. In this article we promote this approach and demonstrate how it can result in better user experiences and more effective learning systems. We present a number of case studies that characterize the impact of interactivity, demonstrate ways in which some existing systems fail to account for the user, and explore new ways for learning systems to interact with their users. We argue that the design process for interactive machine learning systems should involve users at all stages: explorations that reveal human interaction patterns and inspire novel interaction methods, as well as refinement stages to tune details of the interface and choose among alternatives. After giving a glimpse of the progress that has been made so far, we discuss the challenges that we face in moving the field forward.},

As a person adds members to a group, ReGroup iteratively learns a probabilistic model of group membership specific to that group. ReGroup then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that ReGroup is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are better suited for small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on demand group creation, ReGroup can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in ReGroup.},

Following an introductory sketch of relevant research, the first section, `Methodological Considerations', critically examines the limitations the evidence available imposes on our understanding. `Early Uses of Writing' addresses material and spatial aspects of inscriptions, and their communicative functions over the textual ones. The third section, `Material Features', deals with clay, wooden and papyrus manuscripts and demonstrates the importance of an integrated approach. The contributions to `Co-presence of Written Artefacts' take into account that written artefacts come in clusters. The final section, `Cultural Encounters', presents studies on the interactions between social strata and ethnic groups, challenging previous ideas. The volume contributes to the comparative study of written artefacts in ancient history, stimulating cross-disciplinary and -cultural research.},

  abstract = {XQuery is the best language for querying, manipulating, and transforming XML and JSON documents. Because XML is in many ways the lingua franca of the digital humanities, learning XQuery empowers humanists to discover and analyze their data in new ways. Until now, though, XQuery has been difficult to learn because there was no textbook designed for non- or beginner programmers. XQuery for Humanists fills this void with an approachable guidebook aimed directly at digital humanists. Clifford B. Anderson and Joseph C. Wicentowski introduce XQuery in terms accessible to humanities scholars and do not presuppose any prior background in programming. It provides an informed, opinionated overview and recommends the best implementations, libraries, and paradigms to empower those who need it most. Emphasizing practical applicability, the authors go beyond the XQuery language to include the basics of underlying standards like XPath, related standards like XQuery Full Text and XQuery Update, and explain the difference between XQuery and languages like Python and R. This book will afford readers the skills they need to build and analyze large-scale documentary corpora in XML. XQuery for Humanists is immeasurably valuable to instructors of digital humanities and library science courses alike and likewise is a ready reference for faculty, graduate students, and librarians who seek to master XQuery for their projects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a history of pastoralism in the ancient Near East from the Neolithic through the Bronze Age. We describe the accretional development of pastoral technologies over eight millennia, including the productive breeding of domestic sheep, goats, and cattle in the early Neolithic and the subsequent domestication of animals used primarily for labor---donkeys, horses, and finally camels---as well as the first appearance of husbandry strategies such as penning, foddering, pasturing, young male culling, and dairy production. Despite frequent references in the literature to prehistoric pastoral nomads, pastoralism in Southwest Asia was strongly associated with sedentary communities that practiced intensive plant cultivation and was largely local in nature. There is very little evidence in prehistoric and early historic Southwest Asia to support the notion of a ``dimorphic society'' characterized by separate and specialized agriculturists and mobile pastoralists. Although mobile herders were present in the steppe regions of Syria by the early second millennium BC, mobile pastoralism was the exception rather than the rule at that time; its ``identification'' in the archaeological record frequently derives from the application of anachronistic ethnographic analogy. We conclude that pastoralism was a diverse, flexible, and dynamic adaptation in the ancient Near East and call for a reinvigorated and empirically based archaeology of pastoralism in Southwest Asia.},

Often, triple-pattern queries will return too many or too few results, making it difficult for users to find relevant answers to their information needs. To remedy this, we propose a general framework for effective searching of RDF knowledge graphs. Our framework extends both the searched knowledge graph and triple-pattern queries with keywords to allow users to form a wider range of queries. In addition, it provides result ranking based on statistical machine translation, and performs automatic query relaxation to improve query recall. Finally, we also define a notion of result diversity in the setting of RDF data and provide mechanisms to diversify RDF search results using Maximal Marginal Relevance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our retrieval framework using various carefully-designed user studies on DBpedia, a large and real-world RDF knowledge graph.},

  abstract = {The drainage network must take the farming systems and the landscape structure into consideration to describe flow pathways in the agricultural catchment. A new approach is proposed to build the drainage network which is based on the identification of the inlets and outlets for surface water flow on each farmers' field (or plot), estimating the relative areas contributing to the surface yield. The delineation of these areas and their links in terms of surface flow pathways provides us with a pattern of relationships between individual plots, i.e. going from each plot to the other plots over the entire catchment. In this approach, flow directions are firstly calculated in the usual way by taking account of slope direction. Plot outlets are defined from the digital elevation model (DEM) and then linked together using a tree structure. If present, linear networks such as hedges modify both the flow directions and the location of plot outlets, hence modify this tree structure. In a final step, the plots are themselves linked together using a graph structure illustrated by an arrow diagram. This drainage network based on plot outlets is applied to a 15-km2 catchment area represented by 38,300 pixels and 2000 plots. This new drainage network takes into consideration 5300 plot outlets, which greatly reduces the number of objects in comparison with a drainage network made up of pixels or DEM cells. This method leads to a simple and functional representation of surface flow pathways in an agricultural catchment. It allows us to identify the key plots controlling stream water pollution where converging flow pathways are coming from numerous or large-sized plots. Finally, it produces a functional representation for decision support.},

The Neo-Assyrian Empire was constructed on the base of a powerful, well organized and trained army, which defeated all enemies and seemed to be invincible. Babylonia was a special case, because of the complicated political situation and especially its particular geography. Southern Babylonia (nowadays Southern Iraq) was a region of marshes and lagoons, an ideal refuge for rebels. The area could become a mortal trap for those who entered it without knowing it well enough. This region, which represented a severe challenge for the Assyrian army, was called in the Assyrian sources the ``Sealand'', a region where water played a crucial role. The aim of this paper is to show how this particular landscape was perceived by the Assyrians as well as to point out its decisive role in the development of the historical events on the base of the cuneiform sources and the depictions on the stone plates, which decorated the walls of the Assyrian palaces.},

It included all the lands of the peoples of the world and all people helped to maintain imperial order and prosperity. In reality, the empire had boundaries and there were peoples who lived near and beyond them. Under King Darius I, groups of people were annexed at the northeastern and northwestern margins of the imperial territory, thus entering the imperial space and consequently also the Achaemenid documents. The border peoples of the Ya{\textsubarch u}n{\=a} and Sak{\=a} were the only peoples of the empire to be differentiated through epithets, which were added to their collective names in the texts. This shows a unique process of group identity constructions by the authorities on the edges of the imperial space. The analysis of the system of epithets used to indicate the Ya{\textsubarch u}n{\=a} and Sak{\=a} conducted in this paper allows us to draw some conclusions on the mechanisms and reasons behind these specific forms of identity constructions at the margins. Moreover, it shows how this process reflected the main directions of imperial expansion under the first Achaemenids.}

In this study, we make the first attempt to investigate the challenges of adapting these techniques to an extremely low-resource language -- Sumerian cuneiform -- one of the world's oldest written languages attested from at least the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC. Specifically, we introduce the first cross-lingual information extraction pipeline for Sumerian, which includes part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and machine translation. We introduce InterpretLR, an interpretability toolkit for low-resource NLP and use it alongside human evaluations to gauge the trained models. Notably, all our techniques and most components of our pipeline can be generalised to any low-resource language. We publicly release all our implementations including a novel data set with domain-specific pre-processing to promote further research in this domain.},

When faced by a string of unfamiliar names -- in addition to `native Cretans', there are Achaeans, Cydonians and Dorians, as well as the individuals Minos, Deucalion, Idomeneus and the speaker, Aethon (Odysseus in disguise) --, they use their digital edition to find out more about each of these people and their places of origin. A personal name opens an online encyclopaedia entry, while clicking on a place launches an emerging world beyond the single text -- an online atlas that provides information about the place's toponymy, form and exact location as well as links to other resources (textual and archaeological, ancient and modern) about this place, including those to which our student has contributed.

It includes contributions from historians, anthropologists, literary scholars and folklorists who have collaborated closely with De Bl{\'e}court. Essays pick up some or all of the themes and approaches he pioneered, and apply them to cases which range in time and space across all the main regions of Europe since the thirteenth century until the present day. While some draw heavily on texts, others on archival sources, and others on field research, they all share a commitment to reconstructing the meaning and lived experience of witchcraft (and its related phenomena) to Europeans at all levels, respecting the many varieties and ambiguities in such meanings and experiences and resisting attempts to reduce them to master narratives or simple causal models.

The analysis of the written data from the Adab city-state demonstrates that the royal house used the unfree as gifts to maintain a sociopolitical network on three spatial levels -- the internal, local, and (inter)regional. The gift-givers and gift-receivers were mostly male adult members of the local and foreign elite, whereas the dislocated unfree humans were heterogeneous in terms of age, gender, and the ways they lost their freedom. The author relates the social profiles of both groups to the logistics of human traffic to reveal the link between social status and forms and nature of spatial mobility in the politically and socially unstable Early Dynastic Near East.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            This article surveys the Babylonian evidence from inter-city migration of priests and their families. The phenomenon is already attested during the Old Babylonian period and there are some indications that it continued under Kassite rule. However, most of the evidence comes from temple archives of the first millennium and is heavily concentrated during the long sixth century (ca. 626--484               BC               ). Although many studies have identified specific cases of priestly migrations, the phenomenon has not yet been assessed in its entirety. The article concludes that such migrations were far more common than previously thought. They were motivated primarily by political reasons such as imposing the cult of official deities in local sanctuaries, or the need to maintain a memory landscape of venerable cult centers.}

Seamless exchange of information has become the key issue forsuccessful web deployments.  Ontologies provide a way of capturing a shared understanding ofterms that can be used by humans and programs to aid in information exchange.  The ontologyneeds to be specified in some language.  This paper introduces the newest version of OIL -- theontology inference layer -- a proposal that presents a layered approach to a standard ontologylanguage.  It includes modelling constructs found in many widely knowledge representationlanguages, is compatible with RDFS, and includes a precise semantics for describing termmeanings (and thus also for describing implied information).This language has also been used as the basis for defining DAML-Ont, the ontology markuplanguage from the DARPA sponsored DAML initiative (DAML stands for DARPA AgentMarkup Language, see http://www.daml.org). A version of the DAML language, with workingname DAML-OIL, was proposed in a message to the  rdf-logic mailing list(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2000Nov/0094.html) and is very close toStandard OIL as described below.}

Although the southern ruler to whom it is attributed undoubtedly carried out his worship in Hurrian, the present version is written in Hittite, but the text includes numerous Hurrian technical terms. It remains unclear why a rite centering on the Storm-god Te{\v s}{\v s}up of the Kizzuwatnaean capital was still relevant in Hattusa two centuries after its composition.},

I am referring to a generative pattern that in a significant number of such groups, across time and space, has led to constructions of worlds of imagination, and vicarious participation in them through readings or other social acts of imagination that involved ``bracketing the empire out.'' The article focuses on the world of the literati of late Persian Yehud/Judah, and especially the bracketing out of Ramat Rahel, the most obvious and monumental, explicit, imperial site in the province, but a number of various examples from diverse historical and geographical contexts are also brought to bear to make a point that this is a well-instantiated pattern. The article then concludes with a discussion of what was often gained by acts of imagination and memory involved in bracketing out ``empire'' and under which circumstances such acts tended to be historically likely.}

It outlines a methodological approach allowing to integrate data stemming from different lines of inquiry and belonging to different epistemological levels. After introducing the symogih.org project's ontology, it proposes a description of the essential aspects of the process of historical knowledge production. It then develops an epistemological and semantic analysis of conceptual data modelling applied to factual historical information, based on the foundational ontologies Constructive Descriptions and Situations and DOLCE, and discusses the reasons for adopting the CIDOC CRM as a core ontology for the field of historical research, but extending it with some relevant, missing high-level classes. Finally, it shows how collaborative data modelling carried out in the ontology management environment OntoME makes it possible to elaborate a communal fine-grained and adaptive ontology of the domain, provided an active research community engages in this process. With this in mind, the Data for history consortium was founded in 2017 and promotes the adoption of a shared conceptualization in the field of historical research.},

  abstract = {Around the globe, Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are well established in the daily workflow of authorities, businesses and non-profit organisations. GIS can effectively handle spatial entities and offer sophisticated analysis and modelling functions to deal with space. Only a small fraction of the literature in Geographic Information Science\&mdash;or GIScience in short\&mdash;has advanced the development of place, addressing entities with an ambiguous boundary and relying more on the human or social attributes of a location rather than on crisp geographic boundaries. While the GIScience developments support the establishment of the digital humanities, GISs were never designed to handle subjective or vague data. We, an international group of authors, juxtapose place and space in English language and in several other languages and discuss potential consequences for Geoinformatics and GIScience. In particular, we address the question of whether linguistic and cultural settings play a role in the perception of place. We report on some facts revealed by this multi-language and multi-cultural dialogue, and what particular aspects of place we were able to discern regarding the few languages addressed.},

The period in question saw a wide diffusion of writing in the Northwest Semitic alphabetic script - mostly in Aramaic - in Mesopotamia; yet, alphabetic texts were normally written in ink on perishable materials and did not survive to be discovered by modern archaeologists. In contrast, cuneiform tablets written on clay have been found in large numbers, and they document different aspects of the alphabetic scribes' activities. This book presents evidence for understanding the Akkadian term s{\=e}piru as a designation for an alphabetic scribe and discusses the functions of these professionals in different administrative and economic spheres. It further considers the question of the ethnic origins of the alphabetic scribes in Mesopotamia, with special attention to the participation of Judeans in Babylonia in this profession. Bloch also provides translations of over 100 cuneiform documents of economic, legal and administrative content},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The present study discusses the attestations of persons of Judean origin in Neo-Babylonian cuneiform tablets (of the period between 550 and 490               bce               ) as possible evidence of some aspects of the social history of the community of Judeans exiled to Babylonia by Nebuchadnezzar II. Although the number of such attestations is very small, it is nonetheless possible to single out two groups which display different patterns of personal name giving across generations. In one instance, a group of merchants in the city of Sippar (belonging mostly to a single family) uses, in part, distinctly Judean personal names in the first generation of the exile, but abandons them completely in favor of Babylonian theophoric names in the next generation. In another instance, a group of individuals active mostly in Susa and probably belonging to the families of royal officials (as suggested by names and patronymics of the type of               Beamtennamen               -- names expressing a pious wish for the well-being of the king) displays the use of Yahwistic personal names even though the fathers of those individuals bore Babylonian theophoric names. It is suggested that the persistence of Yahwistic -- hence distinctly Judean -- names among royal officials or their direct offspring, even after the previous generation bore Babylonian names, reflects a considerable measure of tolerance toward ethnically foreign elements in the royal administration (the relevant examples date from the period after the establishment of the Achaemenid empire). In contrast, the progressing adoption of Babylonian names among the Judean merchants in Sippar in the first half of the sixth century               bce               seems likely to reflect assimilation into the native Babylonian society, fostered by the necessity to pursue commercial dealings with the Ebabbar temple of {\v S}ama{\v s} and the social circles centered around the temple, which consisted of conservatively minded upper strata of the native Babylonian society. Editions of the cuneiform tablets discussed in the present study are provided in the Appendix.}

  abstract = {[From the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, the number of charitable, benevolent, and religious confraternities increased in the Jewish communities across Europe, especially in Italy. Numerous studies describe these confraternities. This article uncovers and analyzes the nature of the charitable and benevolent confraternities in the Jewish communities of the Ottoman Empire, especially those in western Anatolia and the Balkans, which have yet to receive scholarly attention. The article presents a detailed account of the image of these confraternities during the early modern period. It traces their organization, their leadership and rank-and-file and inquires into the motivations behind the decisions to join the confraternities. Furthermore, it looks into the ways the confraternities operated as economic agencies, philanthropic entities, and cohesive social groups. Relations between the confraternities and the Jewish community are also examined and the cultural world of the members is described with reference to the influence of the surroundings. The discussion of the confraternities in the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century examines their development and describes their transformation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The confraternities underwent two important and concurrent processes: (1) a transition from a general communal confraternity to one with a defined goal, similar to regional and municipal confraternities; (2) a shift of emphasis from philanthropic activity for the needy to the well-being, spiritual and material benefit of the members themselves. Comparisons are made between the Jewish confraternities in the Ottoman empire and their European counterparts. The correlation between the dissolution of the Sephardi kahals and the emergence of the confraternities corroborates the hypothesis concerning the Sephardi origin of the confraternities. They apparently modeled themselves on several organizational and operational features of the Jewish kahals, but there was also a perceptible impact of the Ottoman guilds. This is clearly manifested in the titles of the confraternities' officers, various administrative terms, and the prevailing atmosphere. In this sense, the confraternity served as a mediator between the Jewish community and its surroundings. The role of the confraternities in this regard sheds further evidence on the relationship between Ottoman Jewry and its surroundings and provides evidence of their immersion in Ottoman culture and society. The appendix elaborates on the various types of Jewish confraternities in the cities of the Ottoman Empire, with extensive references to primary sources and research literature.]}

  abstract = {The approaches to data-rich literary history that dominate academic and public debate---Franco Moretti's ``distant reading'' and Matthew Jockers's ``macroanalysis''---model literary systems in limited, abstract, and often ahistorical ways. This problem arises from neglect of the activities and insights of textual scholarship and is inherited from, rather than opposed to, the New Criticism and its core method of ``close reading.'' Literary history requires not new or integrated methods but a new scholarly object capable of managing the documentary record's complexity, especially as manifested in emerging digital knowledge infrastructure. Building on significant, though uneven and unacknowledged, departures from Moretti's and Jockers's work in data-rich literary history, this essay describes such an object, modeled on the foundational technology of textual scholarship: the scholarly edition.},

  abstract = {Libraries, archives and museums hold vast numbers of objects with script in 3D such as inscriptions, coins, and seals, which provide valuable insights into the history of humanity. Cuneiform tablets in particular provide access to information on more than three millennia BC. Since these clay tablets require an extensive examination for transcription, we developed the modular GigaMesh software framework to provide high-contrast visualization of tablets captured with 3D acquisiton techniques. This framework was extended to provide digital drawings exported as XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which are the fundamental input of our approach inspired by machine-learning techniques based on the principle of word spotting. This results in a versatile symbol-spotting algorithm to retrieve graphical elements from drawings enabling automated annotations. Through data homogenization, we achieve compatibility to digitally born manual drawings, as well as to retro-digitized drawings. The latter are found in large Open Access databases, e.g. provided by the Cuneiform Database Library Initiative (CDLI). Ongoing and future work concerns the adaptation of filtering and graphical query techniques for two-dimensional raster images widely used within Digital Humanities research.},

These stone memorials (traditionally called kudurrus) throw light on contemporary legal and economic practices with individual cases involving property rights, royal patronage, family disputes, overzealous functionaries, temple offices and income, and taxation woes. This article assesses a new book which discusses the form and function of these stelae. /// Du XIVe au VIIe s. av.

The volume offers a step-by-step description of network science methods and explores its theoretical foundations and applications in archaeological research, which are elaborately illustrated with archaeological examples. It also covers a vast range of network science techniques that can enhance archaeological research, including network data collection and management, exploratory network analysis, sampling issues and sensitivity analysis, spatial networks, and network visualisation. An essential reference handbook for both beginning and experienced archaeological network researchers, the volume includes boxes with definitions, boxed examples, exercises, and online supplementary learning and teaching materials.},

In the 1830s he became a Member of Parliament and campaigned for social reforms and for the promotion of the temperance movement. He founded several journals, including the periodical The Athenaeum, covering a wide range of topics from literature to popular science. This illustrated two-volume work, published in 1827, recounts Buckingham's journey through Mesopotamia, giving descriptions of its ancient sites and opinions of its modern inhabitants. In Volume 1, Buckingham recounts in great detail his journey from the historic city, Aleppo in Syria to Sinjar (now in north-western Iraq).},

WHAT requires thesauri of topics and tools to explore cross references within and between thesauri. WHERE needs place name gazetteers and map displays. Similarly, for WHEN we developed a directory that connects named time periods with calendar dates and a timeline or chronology. WHO requires best practices and standards for encoding the events in people's lives, for contextualizing those events, and for displaying interpersonal relationships.},

  abstract = {Neanderthals and our human ancestors have coexisted for a large period of time sharing many things in common including the production of tools, which are among the few remaining artefacts providing a possible insight into the different paths of evolvement and extinction. These earliest tools were made of stone using different strategies to reduce a rather round stone to a sharp tool for slicing, scraping, piercing or chopping. The type of strategy is assumed to be correlated either with our ancestors or the Neanderthals. Recent research uses computational methods to analyse shapes of lithic artefacts using Geometric MorphoMetrics (GMM) as known in anthropology. As the main criteria for determining a production strategy are morphologic measures like shape, size, roughness of convex ridges and concave scars, we propose a new method based on discrete Morse theory for surface segmentation to enable GMM analysis in future work. We show the theoretical concepts for the proposed segmentation, which have been applied to a dataset being available via Open Access. For validation we have created a statistically significant subset of segmented simple and complex lithic tools, which have been manually segmented by an expert as ground truth. We finally show results of our experiments on this real dataset.},

The paper aims at exploring the potential of modern 3D data processing and analysis technologies to enhance the analysis of cuneiform script, focusing on its basic element, the wedge. In order to establish a consistent terminological framework for the description of its components, the wedge is considered primarily in its idealized geometrical form, the tetrahedron. The factors that contribute to determine the actual shape of wedge impressions are subsequently singled out and discussed in detail. Finally, the results of an experimental analysis conducted on the wedges' inner angles of six Hittite tablets are presented, being only the `thin edge of the wedge', in order to illustrate the potential of 3D techniques for script analysis and handwriting identification within cuneiform studies.}

This enables RDF statements that describe graphs, which is beneficial in many Semantic Web application areas. As a case study, we explore the application area of Semantic Web publishing: Named Graphs allow publishers to communicate assertional intent, and to sign their graphs; information consumers can evaluate specific graphs using task-specific trust policies, and act on information from those Named Graphs that they accept. Graphs are trusted depending on: their content; information about the graph; and the task the user is performing. The extension of RDF to Named Graphs provides a formally defined framework to be a foundation for the Semantic Web trust layer.},

  abstract = {An emerging arena of archaeological research is beginning to deploy remote sensing technologies---including aerial and satellite imagery, digital topographic data, and drone-acquired and terrestrial geophysical data---not only in support of conventional fieldwork but also as an independent means of exploring the archaeological landscape. This article provides a critical review of recent research that relies on an ever-growing arsenal of imagery and instruments to undertake innovative investigations: mapping regional-scale settlement histories, documenting ancient land use practices, revealing the complexity of settled spaces, building nuanced pictures of environmental contexts, and monitoring at-risk cultural heritage. At the same time, the disruptive nature of these technologies is generating complex new challenges and controversies surrounding data access and preservation, approaches to a deluge of information, and issues of ethical remote sensing. As we navigate these challenges, remote sensing technologies nonetheless offer revolutionary ways of interrogating the archaeological record and transformative insights into the human past.},

  abstract = {The application of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), a laser-based remote-sensing technology that is capable of penetrating overlying vegetation and forest canopies, is generating a fundamental shift in Mesoamerican archaeology and has the potential to transform research in forested areas world-wide. Much as radiocarbon dating that half a century ago moved archaeology forward by grounding archaeological remains in time, LiDAR is proving to be a catalyst for an improved spatial understanding of the past. With LiDAR, ancient societies can be contextualized within a fully defined landscape. Interpretations about the scale and organization of densely forested sites no longer are constrained by sample size, as they were when mapping required laborious on-ground survey. The ability to articulate ancient landscapes fully permits a better understanding of the complexity of ancient Mesoamerican urbanism and also aids in modern conservation efforts. The importance of this geospatial innovation is demonstrated with newly acquired LiDAR data from the archaeological sites of Caracol, Cayo, Belize and Angamuco, Michoac{\'a}n, Mexico. These data illustrate the potential of technology to act as a catalytic enabler of rapid transformational change in archaeological research and interpretation and also underscore the value of on-the-ground archaeological investigation in validating and contextualizing results.},

  abstract = {Historical geographic data are essential for a variety of studies of cancer and environmental epidemiology, urbanization, and landscape ecology. However, existing data sources typically contain only contemporary information. Historical maps hold a great deal of detailed geographic information at various times in the past. Yet, finding relevant maps is difficult, and the map content is not machine-readable. This chapter presents the challenges and trends in building a map processing, modeling, linking, and publishing framework. The framework will enable querying historical map collections as a unified and structured spatiotemporal source in which individual geographic phenomena (extracted from maps) are modeled (described) with semantic descriptions and linked to other data sources (e.g., DBpedia). This framework will allow making use of historical geographic datasets from a variety of maps, efficiently, over large geographic extents. Realizing such a framework poses significant research challenges in multiple fields in computer science including digital map processing, data integration, and the Semantic Web technologies, and other disciplines such as spatial, social, and health sciences. Tackling these challenges will not only advance research in computer science and geographic information science but also present a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research.},

  abstract = {Digital map processing has been an interest in the computer science and geographic information science communities since the early 1980s. With the increase of available map scans, a variety of researchers in the natural and social sciences developed a growing interest in using historical maps in their studies. The lack of an understanding of how historical maps can be used in research and the capabilities of map processing technologies creates a significant gap between the wide range of communities that could benefit from the advances in digital map processing technologies and the disciplines in which the technologies are developed. As a result, researchers who intend to use historical maps in their studies still need a significant amount of resources to digitize their maps, while the existing digital map processing technologies are difficult to apply and understand and thus do not look promising. In many cases, existing digital map processing technologies could help facilitate the digitization process, and it just requires additional knowledge to select an appropriate technology given the problem scope (e.g., the number of maps for processing, map conditions, and style varieties). The result is that researchers waste time and resources building and testing various systems that partially duplicate prior work and cannot fully use the potential of existing technology. This chapter presents real-world applications of historical maps and case studies of both semi-automatic and fully automatic approaches for geographic feature extraction from historical maps. These real-world applications illustrate and exemplify various needs and scopes of using historical maps in scientific studies (e.g., processing thousands of historical maps from a map series vs. a few historical maps from various publishers and with different cartographic styles). The two example map processing technologies described help understand current strengths and weaknesses. These examples also illustrate tremendous collaboration opportunities between and beyond the computer science and geographic information science communities to build advanced map processing technologies that are more effective in transforming the scientific studies that use historical maps.},

  abstract = {Historical map scans contain valuable information (e.g., historical locations of roads, buildings) enabling the analyses that require long-term historical data of the natural and built environment. Many online archives now provide public access to a large number of historical map scans, such as the historical USGS (United States Geological Survey) topographic archive and the historical Ordnance Survey maps in the United Kingdom. Efficiently extracting information from these map scans remains a challenging task, which is typically achieved by manually digitizing the map content. In computer vision, the process of detecting and extracting the precise locations of objects from images is called semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation processes take an image as input and classify each pixel of the image to an object class of interest. Machine learning models for semantic segmentation have been progressing rapidly with the emergence of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs or CNNs). A key factor for the success of CNNs is the wide availability of large amounts of (labeled) training data, but these training data are mostly for daily images not for historical (or any) maps. Today, generating training data needs a significant amount of manual labor that is often impractical for the application of historical map processing. One solution to the problem of training data scarcity is by transferring knowledge learned from a domain with a sufficient amount of labeled data to another domain lacking labeled data (i.e., transfer learning). This chapter presents an overview of deep-learning semantic segmentation models and discusses their strengths and weaknesses concerning geographic feature recognition from historical map scans. The chapter also examines a number of transfer learning strategies that can reuse the state-of-the-art CNN models trained from the publicly available training datasets for the task of recognizing geographic features from historical maps. Finally, this chapter presents a comprehensive experiment for extracting railroad features from USGS historical topographic maps as a case study.},

Cuneiform texts are invaluable sources for the study of history, languages, economy, and cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia and its surrounding regions. Assyriology, the discipline dedicated to their study, has vast research potential, but lacks the modern means for computational processing and analysis. Our project, Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages, aims to fill this gap by bringing together corpus data, lexical data, linguistic annotations and object metadata. The project's main goal is to build a pipeline for machine translation and annotation of Sumerian Ur III administrative texts. The rich and structured data is then to be made accessible in the form of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data (LLOD), which should open them to a larger research community. Our contribution is two-fold: in terms of language technology, our work represents the first attempt to develop an integrative infrastructure for the annotation of morphology and syntax on the basis of RDF technologies and LLOD resources. With respect to Assyriology, we work towards producing the first syntactically annotated corpus of Sumerian.},

  abstract = {Social communication around art and cultural heritage objects occurs mostly on location in the museums and between in-group acquaintances. Such discussions are often brief as competing array of displays and time constraints propel the social arrangement of groups of visitors forward to the next object. Discussions are more often than not fleeting and superficial, and rarely expand beyond the boundary of the group. We postulate that the interactivity afforded by augmented reality that allows the inspection of cultural heritage objects projected onto the real environment of users can be a better experience in terms of depth of viewing. We developed a mobile augmented reality application that allows multiuser interaction and propose that discussions that occur around cultural heritage objects can be replicated, and that such discussions can be expanded beyond in-groups. We conducted hypotheses testing across 10 groups of 30 participants to investigate if aspects of social communication can be facilitated or impeded by the perceived realism or artificiality of objects and explore which features of Social AR are more important for communication. The research aims to understand how social communication would work for AR when co-viewing heritage objects. The results have implications for necessitating cross-border and cross-cultural exchanges in an increasingly virtually connected world.},

Our cases study are taken from the project ``Gustave Roud, {\OE}uvres compl{\`e}tes'', whose principal aim is to edit the complete works of the Swiss author Gustave Roud (1897-1976). Roud's writing process is rooted in his diary: a first note, for instance taken during a walk in the countryside, can be typed or copied together with other notes in a dedicated notebook, and then inserted in a journal article, which will be itself modified and assembled with others to form a poetic collection. This mechanism of rhapsodic montage is used at various stages of the writing processes, allowing for multiple assemblages of the same materials, for new texts to be produced from existing ones and for the same diary note to appear in multiple texts. In this article, we present an ontology for modelling the genetic relationships between the documents. The available data-model for genetic criticism are firstly discussed: they concentrate on a single document or on the textual variation between them, but no formal model for their relationships is available. Existing visualizations of those relationships are then taken into account. The ontology that we propose to fill this void is detailed and its compatibility with widespread conceptual models, such as FRBRoo and CIDOC CRM, is discussed. Two case studies are presented to test the ontology. In the article we consider the application of our model to other corpora and we conclude with suggestions for the improvement of this work.},

  abstract = {The debate on the semantic role of markup languages has been quite lively and the TEI community has played an active part in it. It is commonly acknowledged that markup conveys semantic information. However, XML is a poor language for semantic data modeling. Several proposals have previously been drawn up in the past to provide XML with formalized and computable semantics. In our opinion, the formalisms offered by the Semantic Web paradigm are mature enough to build a workable semantic extension of the TEI. Our model distinguishes three semantic layers in the TEI: one general and shared intensional semantic layer; one idiolectal specialized layer; and finally an extensional semantics. Our proposal is directed toward the first two layers. We propose to build such semantic layers by adopting a set of OWL formal ontologies. Furnishing the TEI with a semantics based on a formal ontology could have interesting outcomes: facilitating the management of and research using document collections in open and multi-standard contexts; aiding interoperability with other relevant standards in the digital cultural heritage context; and providing users with advanced formal tools to semantically define their interpretations of the texts and enable innovative computational processing. In order to allow a semantic interoperability between standards, the TEI ontology has to be aligned to other models; likewise mapping and merging procedures have to be evaluated. Finally, the idea of migrating XML/TEI documents following this semantic model into a linked open data dimension requires that we face important issues in order to facilitate the data interchange in the cloud. However, the cost and the practical complexity of such an extension are notable, and several theoretical problems, format choices, and implementation details are still to be defined.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the use of technologies traditionally associated with knowledge representation to express complex associations between entities in historical texts that have been marked up in XML, according to the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines. In particular, we describe our exploration of the potential role of an ontology in facilitating the interpretation of implicit and hidden associations in the sources of interest, examining its use, and limits in a digital humanities project in connection with editing tools and delivery issues. We demonstrate our findings based on the Henry III Fine Rolls project, where an ontology-built using the RDF (Resource Description Framework)/OWL (Web Ontology Language) technologies-is being developed to make explicit information about person, place, and subject entities marked up as instances in the core texts themselves. For any historian, there is a natural tension between primary sources (as documentary records) and the analysis that produces a context for interpretation. We will argue that the combination of core mark-up (encoded in TEI) and an ontology (in RDF/OWL) provides a powerful model for representing the complexity of this tension and facilitates the necessarily dynamic process of scholarly interpretation.},

  abstract = {Modellieren: Denken in Anwendung. Eine Einf{\"u}hrung<<. In this introduction of the HSR Supplement ``Models and Modelling between Digital and Humanities - A Multidisciplinary Perspective'' we refrain from providing a normative definition of `model' and `modelling' and rather attempt at encircling the current state of the art. In the first instance this chapter provides a very brief overview on modelling as intended as a research strategy applied to scientific fields in the 20th-21st centuries. This overview is followed by a short introduction to modelling in digital humanities, focusing on how modelling has developed into a practical strategy and how it has been theorised. The third part of the introduction presents the scope of the project ''Modelling between digital and humanities: Thinking in practice''. The aim of a project workshop held in 2017, of which this volume collects the proceedings, was to present a multitude of modelling practices from various disciplines together with different theoretical frameworks. The fourth part of this introduction offers an overview of each of the papers in this volume. Finally, a fifth section constitutes the first item of the proceedings as it reproduces an adaptation of the dialogue which was performed to introduce the main topics of the workshop and the scope of the project at the event itself. It serves to illustrate the way we organised the workshop and how the exchanges amongst participants were facilitated.},

By comparing the visual and textual references to these camps with the surroundings of the cities he besieged (on site and via aerial and satellite imagery, archaeological and historical data, and early maps and surveys), likely locations are proposed for Sennacherib's royal camps. These sites are found to have all had the same name on early maps, Mudawwara, which, in Arabic in the Middle Ages, denoted the enormous tent that housed the sultan on military expeditions. (At times, this name was prefaced with Khirbet al, indicating the ancient stone ruins thereof.) Examining all occurrences of this toponym within Judah and Philistia reveals a distribution consistent with what is known of Sennacherib's invasion route and of the cities besieged. It also resolves some long-standing questions and contributes to identifying the locations of the cities of Libnah and Nob.},

This GRDDL specification introduces markup based on existing standards for declaring that an XML document includes data compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and for linking to algorithms (typically represented in XSLT), for extracting this data from the document. The markup includes a namespace-qualified attribute for use in general-purpose XML documents and a profile-qualified link relationship for use in valid XHTML documents. The GRDDL mechanism also allows an XML namespace document (or XHTML profile document) to declare that every document associated with that namespace (or profile) includes gleanable data and for linking to an algorithm for gleaning the data. A corresponding GRDDL Use Case Working Draft provides motivating examples. A GRDDL Primer demonstrates the mechanism on XHTML documents which include widely-deployed dialects known as microformats. A GRDDL Test Cases document illustrates specific issues in this design and provides materials to aid in test-driven development of GRDDL-aware agents.},

A service that combines different metadata sources should be aware of the existence of different schemas to store and exchange music metadata. The user of a metadata provider could benefit from knowledge about the metadata needs for different music application domains. In this paper, we present how we can compare the expressiveness and richness of a metadata schema for an application. To cope with different levels of granularity in metadata fields we defined clusters of semantically related metadata fields. Similarly, application domains were defined to tackle the fine-grained functionality space in music applications. Next is shown to what extent music application domains and metadata schemas make use of the metadata field clusters. Finally, we link the metadata schemas with the application domains. A decision table is presented that assists the user of a metadata provider in choosing the right metadata schema for his application.},

[...] Because of climate change, resources today are under threat from long-term trends which are quite difficult to predict with precision on a regional basis, but which are however certain to occur. T[...] In this context, a return to traditional cultural heritages linked to water -- some dating back more than a thousand years - would seem to be a necessary, or at least useful, approach. The initial aim of the approach we are adopting here is to provide assistance for recognising, studying and preserving heritage of this type. From this viewpoint, the framework provided by the World Heritage Convention is an important tool, and can provide instructive insights, when it comes to identifying sites and cultural landscapes with Outstanding Universal Value which are linked to the exploitation and use of water by human societies both today and in the past. It can play perhaps an even more important role in providing a methodology for the identification and then the preservation of such heritages, in a wider context, not only for properties which could be nominated for the World Heritage List, but also for properties of regional or local importance. The aim will also be to establish benchmark examples, which are highlighted for the benefit of everyone, and whose transmission to future generations can be assured in an appropriate way."

While the utility of Linked Data to non-tech savvy web users is evident, the lack of technical knowledge and an understanding of the intricacies of the semantic technology stack limit such users in their ability to interpret and make use of the Web of Data. A key solution in overcoming this hurdle is to visualise Linked Data in a coherent and legible manner, allowing non-domain and non-technical audiences to obtain a good understanding of its structure, and therefore implicitly compose queries, identify links between resources and intuitively discover new pieces of information. In this paper we describe key requirements which the visualisation of Linked Data must fulfil in order to lower the technical barrier and make the Web of Data accessible for all. We provide an extensive survey of current efforts in the Semantic Web community with respect to our requirements, and identify the potential for visual support to lead to more effective, intuitive interaction of the end user with Linked Data. We conclude with the conclusions drawn from our survey and analysis, and present proposals for advancing current Linked Data visualisation efforts.},

  abstract = {Musical data can be analysed, combined, transformed and exploited for diverse purposes. However, despite the proliferation of dig- ital libraries and repositories for music, infrastructures and tools, such uses of musical data remain scarce. As an initial step to help fill this gap, we present a survey of the landscape of musical data on the Web, available as a Linked Open Dataset: the musoW dataset of catalogued musical resources. We present the dataset and the methodology and cri- teria for its creation and assessment. We map the identified dimensions and parameters to existing Linked Data vocabularies, present insights gained from SPARQL queries, and identify significant relations between resource features. We present a thematic analysis of the original research questions associated with surveyed resources and identify the extent to which the collected resources are Linked Data-ready.},

Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, while still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general.  In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.},

The tools developed by Interedition's `Prototyping' working group were tested by other research teams, which formulate strategic recommendations. To this purpose, the Centre for Manuscript Genetics (University of Antwerp), the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (The Hague), and the University of Wurzburg have been working together within the framework of Interedition. One of the concrete results of collaboration is the development and fine-tuning of the text collation tool CollateX.[2][2] In this article, we would like to investigate how the architecture of a digital archive containing modern manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users can autonomously collate textual units of their choice with the help of the collation tool CollateX and thus decide for themselves how efficiently this digital architecture functions---as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or as an edition. The first part introduces CollateX and its internal concepts and heuristics as a tool for digitally supported collation. How this tool can be integrated in the infrastructure of an electronic edition is discussed in part two. The third and final part examines the possibility of deploying CollateX for the collation of modern manuscripts by means of a test case: the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project ([www.beckettarchive.org][3]).

Some of these have received a lot of attention (especially overlap), and some have received less (e.g., discontinuity, simultaneity, transposition, white space as crypto-overlap). Many of these have work-arounds, also well known, but---as is implicit in the term ``work-around''---these work-arounds have disadvantages. Because they get the job done, however, and because XML has a large user community with diverse levels of technological expertise, it is difficult to overcome inertia and move to a technology that might offer a more comprehensive fit with the full range of document structures with which researchers need to interact both intellectually and programmatically. A high-level analysis of why XML has the limitations it has can enable us to explore how an alternative model of Text as Graph (TAG) might address these types of structures and tasks in a more natural and idiomatic way than is available within an XML paradigm.}

  abstract = {This paper is a study of the topos of the king burning captives in the Assyrian royal inscriptions. This punishment is notable for both its rarity and its cruelty, being the only time that the royal inscriptions describe violence towards children. I approach this topic in terms of Donald Black's model of social control, in which the form and severity of social control, including violence, varies in relation to the ``social geometry'' that separates the parties involved in a dispute or conflict. I argue that in the royal inscriptions burning is inflicted on those that the Assyrians saw as ``uncivilized'': peoples inhabiting poorer cities in mountain regions who lacked the infrastructure necessary to stockpile prestige goods, such as precious metals, and were separated at a greater distance from Assyria by ``social geometry'' than other foreigners. These findings provide a useful insight into Assyrian conceptions of the other and give a better understanding of the variations in the severity of punishments inflicted by the Assyrians on their enemies.}

  abstract = {One of the most evident tenets of the literature on overlapping markup is that the philosophy of documents as trees (as dictated by meta-markup languages such as SGML and XML) is a simplification that sometimes fails and requires corrections. These corrections have been proposed at the markup level (e.g., milestones, segmentation), at the meta-markup level (e.g., LMNL, TexMecs, XCONCUR, etc.) or at level of the abstract model (e.g., GODDAG). Unfortunately full GODDAGs do not allow linearizations in general, and as such a restricted version of GODDAG, r-GODDAG, has been proposed that is guaranteed to be linearizable (in TexMecs) and still allows many nice features beyond trees. In this paper we discuss that the problem of linearizing more-than-hierarchical structures lies basically in the embedding of markup within content and that no such problem arises with an appropriate standoff approach, that is able to represent full GODDAGs without restrictions. This gives ample opportunities to deal with interesting markup features that are describable with GODDAGs but not with r-GODDAGs, such as non-contiguous elements and virtual elements. Besides, we discuss whether a specific constraint of full GODDAGs is really necessary once all residual hopes of embeddability are given up, and we further propose a minimal extension to GODDAG, genially called "extended GODDAG" (e-GODDAG) that, by removing the requirement for names in non-terminal nodes, adds support for additional interesting markup features such as content repetitions. In truth, e-GODDAGs are even less embeddable than full GODDAGs, but they are just as easily dealt with by using stand-off markup. We further propose a meta-syntax for non-embedded markup, called EARMARK, that can be used for stand-off annotations of textual content, and that naturally represents e-GODDAGs with fully W3C-compliant technologies. EARMARK is based on an ontologically precise definition of markup that instantiates the markup of a text document as an OWL document, and through appropriate OWL and SWRL characterizations it can define structures such as trees, r-GODDAGs, full GODDAGs and e-GODDAGs, and can be used to generate validity constraints (including co-constraints), and to verify adherence to content model patterns. As mentioned, in general the embedding of a full EARMARK document is not straightforward, but approaches can be taken in that direction: just like segmentation and fragmentation are strategies to embed in a strictly-hierarchical language a r-GODDAG-specific feature such as overlapping elements, similarly a number of strategies exist to provide embedding of GODDAG and e-GODDAG features in less expressive syntaxes. In the final part of the paper we discuss our wish to provide at the metalanguage level a series of embedding strategies of the non-hierarchical features of EARMARK, i.e. a number of language-independent mechanisms to express e-GODDAGs structures into XML (as well as in TexMecs and in LMNL) and that can be recognized as such (i.e., as strategies, as tricks) by tools and readers alike, especially for further uses of such documents.},

  abstract = {Lists, one of the most archaic literary genres, stand behind many of our complex mental or rhetorical structures and they often influence the way we conceptualize the world (even if we are unaware of it). They seem plain but may conceal a complicated inner logic. They are agrammatical but may tell a story. Their basic features - selection, order, and layout - may be enough to give them enormous power: by including they exclude, by ordering they create a hierarchy, by taking on particular physical aspects they place themselves into a specific context. These and other issues are discussed in the present transdisciplinary volume collecting the best revised contributions to a workshop on lists held at the Center for Theoretical Study in Prague in November 2008. Each of the 13 articles by researchers from seven countries provides a case study on the subject of list. The fields covered include late antique, medieval and early modern history, philology, philosophy, cognitive and computer science. The contributors aim both at presenting particular cases - specific lists or list-types - and, at the same time, at addressing methodological issues: exploring the ways of researching lists in their particular disciplines, formulating relevant research themes and questions, contextualizing the subject. Since theoretical discourse on lists has not been established yet, this volume should be seen as a first step in the process, showing the variety of possible research directions on a transdisciplinary level, and raising interest in the topic, which, although it may seem a bit obscure at first, has indeed a lot to offer.},

  abstract = {Drupal is a free and open-source content management framework. It is, like many web platforms, the ``backbone'' behind a website, invisible to front-end users but critical to the foundation, organization, and presentation of content. As more scholars and students seek to make their research available online---using the power of the web to find newer and richer ways of presenting large data sets---they are increasingly reaching the limits of what ``old'' platforms can accomplish. Author Quinn Dombrowski has taught numerous courses in Drupal programming for scholars in the humanities; the techniques here have been field tested. The majority of this book is centered around the creation of an example website, based on a fully functional website that is driven by Drupal.Drupal for Humanists~is the first book on Drupal to be crafted specifically for non-technical users. This manual does not assume any prior experience with PHP, FTP, databases, CMS, or even HTML. If these acronyms are unfamiliar, Drupal for Humanists is the place to start.},

The suggestion put forward in this article is that traditional language description reimagined in the context of the Digital Humanities has the capacity to create models, which can be re-used mutatis mutandis for other languages. The methodology makes use of MaLex, which is a collection of procedures and datasets designed for Malay in the first instance, but with the potential to be modified for other languages. MaLex is placed in its historical context within the Humanities, and digital procedures are explicitly connected to traditional scholarship. The use of digital methods creates new opportunities to scale up practical linguistic analysis using large datasets. MaLex procedures include a stemmer, a tagger, a parser, and a spelling-to-phoneme algorithm, and make a rough English translation of Malay text. MaLex simulates the approach of the practical linguist analysing a new language, and as new components are added, they are made to integrate with existing components, so that MaLex works like a single machine, drawing on an integrated infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is a precious historical and cultural resource of a country. Protection and inheritance of ICH is important to the sustainable development of national culture. There are many different intangible cultural heritage items in China. With the development of information technology, ICH database resources were built by government departments or public cultural services institutions, but most databases were widely dispersed. Certain traditional database systems are disadvantageous to storage, management and analysis of massive data. At the same time, a large quantity of data has been produced, accompanied by digital intangible cultural heritage development. The public is unable to grasp key knowledge quickly because of the massive and fragmented nature of the data. To solve these problems, we proposed the intangible cultural heritage knowledge graph to assist knowledge management and provide a service to the public. ICH domain ontology was defined with the help of intangible cultural heritage experts and knowledge engineers to regulate the concept, attribute and relationship of ICH knowledge. In this study, massive ICH data were obtained, and domain knowledge was extracted from ICH text data using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. A knowledge base based on domain ontology and instances for Chinese intangible cultural heritage was constructed, and the knowledge graph was developed. The pattern and characteristics behind the intangible cultural heritage were presented based on the ICH knowledge graph. The knowledge graph for ICH could foster support for organization, management and protection of the intangible cultural heritage knowledge. The public can also obtain the ICH knowledge quickly and discover the linked knowledge. The knowledge graph is helpful for the protection and inheritance of intangible cultural heritage.},

  abstract = {In our current screen-saturated culture, we take in more information through visual means than at any point in history. The computers and smart phones that constantly flood us with images do more than simply convey information. They structure our relationship to information through graphical formats. Learning to interpret how visual forms not only present but produce knowledge, says Johanna Drucker, has become an essential contemporary skill. Graphesis provides a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge. In an interdisciplinary study fusing digital humanities with media studies and graphic design history, Drucker outlines the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content. Among the most significant of these formats is the graphical user interface (GUI)---the dominant feature of the screens of nearly all consumer electronic devices. Because so much of our personal and professional lives is mediated through visual interfaces, it is important to start thinking critically about how they shape knowledge, our behavior, and even our identity. Information graphics bear tell-tale signs of the disciplines in which they originated: statistics, business, and the empirical sciences. Drucker makes the case for studying visuality from a humanistic perspective, exploring how graphic languages can serve fields where qualitative judgments take priority over quantitative statements of fact. Graphesis offers a new epistemology of the ways we process information, embracing the full potential of visual forms and formats of knowledge production.},

  abstract = {This article presents an epistemological rationale, intellectual justification, and design outline for a non-representational approach to modeling interpretation in a graphical environment. It begins with a brief critical discussion of the representational approaches that are the common form of information visualizations and suggests that the less familiar non-representational approach could be used to augment these existing visualizations by supporting interpretative work that is closer to the practice of humanistic hermeneutic traditions. Representational display, based on large-scale processing, surrogates, and conventional visualizations, and non-representational modeling at the level of the individual interpretative act operate at very different scales to support intellectual work. In a representational approach, data precede display. Display is a surrogate produced according to automated protocols and algorithms. These cannot be altered or intervened except through rewriting their code, and the display, though interpretative and subject to interpretation, cannot be used as a means by which interpretation is actually modeled. While all visualizations express a model, they do not all provide a modeling environment. In the non-representational approach proposed here, graphical input serves as a primary means of interpretative work. More significantly, a graphical environment that supports direct modeling of interpretation allows traditional humanistic approaches, close reading, and marking of texts, documents, artifacts, or images, to be integrated with computationally produced visualizations. This research was developed as part of the 3DH (three-dimensional/digital humanities) project hosted at the University of Hamburg, between April and June 2016.},

My case study is the Hittite Empire, which dominated parts of what is now modern Turkey and northern Syria between the seventeenth and twelfth centuries BCE, and its borderlands. To investigate the identities of the Hittite imperial system, I explore the totality of the second millennium BCE in two regions. First, I explore imperial dynamics and responses in the Ilg{\i}n Plain in inner southwestern Turkey through a study of the material collected by the Yalburt Yaylas{\i} Archaeological Landscape Research Project since 2010. Second, I explore the identity of the Hittite Empire in the city of Emar in northern Syria by a thorough study of the textual and archaeological material unearthed by the Emar Expedition. In both cases, I argue that the manifestations of the Hittite Empire were mainly conditioned by the pre-Hittite trajectories of these regions. The strategies that the administration chose to use in different borderlands sought to identify what was important locally, with the Hittite Empire integrating itself into networks that were already established as manifestations of power, instead of replacing them with new ones.}

Reciprocal gift exchange within the framework of diplomatic contacts and redistributive mobility of goods in asymmetric political relations shaped regional and supra-regional communication in different ways. Following the detailed discussions about modes of culture contacts and exchanges in previous research the contributions in the present volume address questions of the specific mechanisms and routes of exchange. How and by which means did material commodities and knowledge circulate among the Great Powers, lesser independent states and vassal kingdoms of the Aegean, Anatolia, Syria, the Levant, Mesopotamia and Egypt? Where did the different raw materials and finished products come from, and under which conditions and by whom were they negotiated? Is it possible to determine regions of production and direct and indirect channels of distribution? Which rules were applied in the supra-regional exchange? Which possibilities and which obligations did the vassal kingdoms of the Levant have towards the Great Powers of the Hittites, Assyrians and Egyptians? Which role did the Mycenaean palaces of the Aegean play within the "international" network of exchanges? Can we develop a model of political and economic interaction? During the symposium at Freiburg University archaeologists, philologists and historians discussed these issues on the basis of the current evaluation of the archaeological and written evidence within an interdisciplinary framework and developed perspectives on the specific forms of exchange (re)considering the interaction of political and economic forces},

One method of establishing meaning in TEI documents is achieved via linking mechanisms between TEI and external ontologies.

Two pit-like features, which differed considerably from one another in colour, texture and content, were excavated. Evidence shows that each feature represents a different in situ activity related to iron production, inferred by the presence of hammerscales, slag prills and slag. An upturned crucible was found on top of one of the features. Analysis of the crucible slag showed that it was used for bronze metallurgy. Tuy{\`e}res, both round and square in cross-section, were found in and around the two features. The presence of the two industries together presents a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between copper and iron working. This is especially important against the background of the scarcity of evidence for iron production in the Levant during the early phases of the Iron Age.},

Creating such interfaces is difficult because of the image and signal processing knowledge required for creating classifiers.

The concept and implementation details of IML are discussed and contrasted with classical machine learning models. Evaluations of two algorithms are also presented. We also briefly describe Image Processing with Crayons (Crayons), which is a tool for creating new camera-based interfaces using a simple painting metaphor. The Crayons tool embodies our notions of interactive machine learning},

  abstract = {Continental aquatic systems from rivers to the coastal zone are considered within two perspectives: (i) as a major link between the atmosphere, pedosphere, biosphere and oceans within the Earth system with its Holocene dynamics, and (ii) as water and aquatic biota resources progressively used and transformed by humans. Human pressures have now reached a state where the continental aquatic systems can no longer be considered as being controlled by only Earth system processes, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene. Riverine changes, now observed at the global scale, are described through a first set of syndromes (flood regulation, fragmentation, sediment imbalance, neo--arheism, salinization, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication and microbial contamination) with their related causes and symptoms. These syndromes have direct influences on water uses, either positive or negative. They also modify some Earth system key functions such as sediment, water, nutrient and carbon balances, greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic biodiversity. Evolution of river syndromes over the past 2000 years is complex: it depends upon the stages of regional human development and on natural conditions, as illustrated here for the chemical contamination syndrome. River damming, eutrophication and generalized decrease of river flow due to irrigation are some of the other global features of river changes. Future management of river systems should also consider these long--term impacts on the Earth system.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, a remarkable number of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) were developed, such as DBpedia, NELL and Google knowledge graph. These KGs are the core of many web-based applications such as query answering and semantic web navigation. The majority of these KGs are semi-automatically constructed, which has resulted in a significant degree of heterogeneity. KGs are highly complementary; thus, mapping them can benefit intelligent applications that require integrating different KGs such as recommendation systems and search engines. Although the problem of ontology matching has been investigated and a significant number of systems have been developed, the challenges of mapping large-scale KGs remain significant. In 2018, OAEI has introduced a specific track for KG matching systems. Nonetheless, a major limitation of the current benchmark is their lack of representation of real-world KGs. In this work we introduce a gold standard dataset for matching the schema of large, automatically constructed, less-well structured KGs based on DBpedia and NELL. We evaluate OAEI's various participating systems on this dataset, and show that matching large-scale and domain independent KGs is a more challenging task. We believe that the dataset which we make public in this work makes the largest domain-independent gold standard dataset for matching KG classes.},

This first volume about both series focuses on the cuneiform tablets on which the texts were written, from the british museum, london, the vorderasiatisches museum, berlin, and the oriental institute, chicago. New hand copies and sketches show the physical and non-physical joins. Viewing the tablets as archaeological objects, the author provides numerous observations about format, shape, colour, 'firing holes', worm holes and trace fossils. The ways scribes marked out their tablets with horizontal lines (sometimes doubled) to separate entries or paragraphs or provide ruled tablets are described; vertical rulings defined the left edge and column divisions (sometimes replaced by a glossenkeil). Areas reserved for writing, layout, slanted lines of writing, alignment and indentation of paragraphs, line spacing and ductus (especially changes from middle to neo-assyrian) are carefully examined. the last chapter concentrates on scribal corrections and various correction marks, line markers and supplementary glosses. Such features illuminate the personal preferences and professional experience of the frequently anonymous scribes behind the tablets.},

This study suggests that both originated in the Northern Kingdom and that they were set down in writing in the early to mid-eighth century. They create a map that is a mosaic of continuous territory which includes the central hill country west of the Jordan River, the Jezreel Valley and regions immediately to its north, and the Gilead---the area that was conceived as the core terrain of the Northern Kingdom in its early days.

  abstract = {The absence of a true Achaemenid Persian ``historiography'' necessitates that we look elsewhere to construct Persian ideological interactions with the periphery. Like many Mesopotamian kings before them, the Achaemenids became famous for their collecting practices, and sources often depict them looting and stealing artifacts---many of an antiquarian nature---from conquered peoples. Recently, scholars have argued that we should read this picture as a later Greco-Roman historiographical construct, meant to retroactively vilify the Persian kings for their involvement in Hellenic affairs. However, the archaeological record, read together with cuneiform sources, appears to corroborate these statements. The careful recontextualization in Persian capitals of important cultural heritage items, looted mainly from religious environments in rebellious areas, served not only to demonstrate the superiority and dominance of the Persian center over the periphery but also to situate the Persian kings in an historical continuum of Mesopotamian kingship. A reevaluation of Achaemenid collecting practices from the sixth to the fourth centuries BCE may allow for a more complete understanding of the discursive nature of Persian imperial display.}

  abstract = {We research the problem of building knowledge maps of graph-like information. There exist well-consolidated cartographic principles and techniques for mapping physical landscapes. However, we live in the digital era and similarly to the Earth, the Web is simply too large and its interrelations too complex for anyone to grasp much of it through direct observation. Thus, the problem of applying cartographic principles also to digital landscapes is intriguing. We introduce a mathematical formalism that captures the general notion of map of a graph and enables its development and manipulation in a semi-automated way. We present an implementation of our formalism on the Web of Linked Data graph and discuss algorithms that efficiently generate and combine (via an algebra) regions and maps. We present the MaGe tool, implementing the map framework, and discuss examples of knowledge maps.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Given the growing expansion in the development and use of computational methods in humanities research, it is necessary to propose methodologies that properly explore the questions posed by different disciplines, considering the locality of both data and the process behind its generation. In the present work, we explore the problem of automatically identifying the main topics in collections of Nahua discourses known as huehuetlahtollis. Each document in the collections is introduced through an extended title, and it is a natural question if enhancing the role of title terms during the unsupervised learning process could enrich results. Aiming at explainability, we consider a model based on nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMF). An overview of the historical process behind the composition of the explored corpora suggests that titles reflect the point of view of the collection's compiler in manners that justify viewing the paratext as a supplementary source on the material. Therefore, we propose a bi-objective NMF scheme that appropriately reflects the a priori knowledge on the corpus, linking and combining the information of titles and content to improve the accuracy in identifying topic groups and relevant terms within a corpus. By comparing three different schemes against the labels assigned by an expert, we show that our model better reflects the nature of data, translating into higher accuracy. Finally, we present some insights on the studied corpora derived from our analysis of identified relevant terms.},

  abstract = {One of the oldest complete suits of European armour was discovered in 1960 near the village of Dendra, in Southern Greece, but it remained unknown whether this armour was suitable for extended use in battle or was purely ceremonial. This had limited our understanding of the ancient Greek--Late Bronze Age--warfare and its consequences that have underpinned the social transformations of prehistoric Europe and Eastern Mediterranean. In a series of archeo-physiological studies, merging knowledge in archaeology, history, human physiology, and numerical simulation, we provide supporting evidence that the Mycenaean armour found at Dendra was entirely compatible with use in extended combat, and we provide a free software enabling simulation of Late Bronze Age warfare. A group of special armed-forces personnel wearing a replica of the Dendra armour were able to complete an 11-hour simulated Late Bronze Age combat protocol that we developed from a series of studies based on the available evidence. Numerical simulation of the thermal exchanges in Late Bronze Age warfare extended this conclusion across different environmental conditions and fighting intensities. Our results support the notion that the Mycenaeans had such a powerful impact in Eastern Mediterranean at least partly as a result of their armour technology.},

Unfortunately, some parts of the inscribed texts become illegible over time. Special experts, called epigraphists, use time-consuming manual procedures to estimate the missing content. This problem can be considered an extended masked language modeling task, where the damaged content can comprise single characters, character n-grams (partial words), single complete words, and multi-word n-grams.This study is the first attempt to apply the masked language modeling approach to corrupted inscriptions in Hebrew and Aramaic languages, both using the Hebrew alphabet consisting mostly of consonant symbols. In our experiments, we evaluate several transformer-based models, which are fine-tuned on the Biblical texts and tested on three different percentages of randomly masked parts in the testing corpus. For any masking percentage, the highest text completion accuracy is obtained with a novel ensemble of word and character prediction models.}

The ability to collate speech data from different researchers and to leverage external repositories of texts and characters opens up new possibilities for interrogation of the epic corpus. We briefly survey the current state of scholarship on epic speeches and of the digital infrastructure on which we propose to build. We outline a model for harmonizing speech data across studies and aligning it with existing LOD standards. Finally, we discuss some early proof-of-concept results and the larger implications of this approach for the field. The long-term aim of the DICES project is to build a database of metadata on direct speech in Greek and Latin epic, not only covering canonical texts such as Homer and Virgil, but also including the less-studied texts of the late antique period, which will benefit greatly both from the increased accessibility and also from the diachronic perspective afforded by a corpus-based approach. The envisioned database also has the potential to include diachronic data from additional genres and languages at a later stage.},

It draws together more than 40 years of research by one of the world's leading experts in Assyriology to offer an exhaustive survey of the Akkadian empire.  Addressing all aspects of the empire, including its statecraft and military, territory and cities, arts, religion, economy, and production, The Age of Agade considers what can be said of Akkadian political and social history, material culture, and daily life. A final chapter also explores how the empire has been presented in modern historiography, from the decipherment of cuneiform to the present, including the extensive research of Soviet historians, summarized here in English for the first time. Drawing on contemporaneous written and artifactual sources, as well as relevant materials from succeeding generations, Foster introduces the reader to the wealth of evidence available. Accessibly written by a specialist in the field, this book is an engaging examination of a critical era in the history of early Mesopotamia.},

The name and titulary of the king in question are not preserved, and the attribution of the inscription is accordingly uncertain. Following Jean-Vincent Scheil's attribution of the text already in 1902, the study that accompanies an edition of the text argues that it should be attributed to Nabonidus, king of Babylon 556--539 BC, and explores its historical significance in this context.},

  abstract = {While space syntax analysis has been widely applied to archaeological sites (including Pompeii), it is fundamentally limited by its isolation within the social sciences and its omission of decoration from the analysis of human cognition and movement within structures. At the same time, phenomenology in archaeology has typically arisen from the physical experiences of a limited number of professional archaeologists in a landscape, with little interest in digital embodiment in virtual spaces. The Virtual Pompeii Project has produced an updated version of space syntax which combines network measures common in the social sciences with visibility graphs to produce predictive models of movement within a set of three ancient Roman houses in Pompeii. These predictive models are tested through the navigation of virtual models of the houses by human subjects, demonstrating the significance of decoration in shaping movement, and, through quantitative and qualitative data, the value of digitally embodied phenomenology. This points ahead to the use of crowd-sourced, web-based global testing, diversifying the subject pool far beyond the narrow bounds of professional classicists or archaeologists.},

  abstract = {Archaeological data are by nature spatial but also imperfect. Indeed, archaeological information is subject to uncertainty, imprecision, vagueness and incompleteness. In order to deal with that imperfection and to consider it throughout the treatment of data and spatial analyses, several uncertainty theories have been proposed in the literature. The fuzzy set theory introduced by L. A. Zadeh in 1965 considers that an element might have a partial (and gradual) membership of a set. Partial membership allows for the treatment of the Sorites Paradox and, therefore, the representation of an imprecise or vague statement. For instance, fuzzy spatial data and modelling may help in designing a model that is close to the reality of data acquisition, or be used in excavation to represent both the findspot location of an artefact and its estimated original point of deposition. It may even help in managing the uncertainty inherent to predictive modelling. This chapter will present a review of the use of fuzzy spatial modelling of archaeological data, introducing fuzzy sets theory and illustrating its use with two case studies.},

It is the capacity of ritual to differentiate, and to be differentiated from other activities, that provides a group with a framework for seeing what they are doing as being meaningfully different than ordinary. Without the proper focusing lens -- ritualization -- special nonordinary acts and objects can look very mundane indeed. Furthermore, there is often a stark contrast between what ritual actually does, and what is claimed is being done. This study analyzes a first millennium BCE ritual from Mesopotamia -- attested both archaeologically and textually -- that deals with preparing and manufacturing various materials and paraphernalia necessary for laying a temple's foundations, to underscore (1) the fundamental utility of these notions in broadly studying ritual, (2) the processes and mechanisms that transform ordinary materials into special, perhaps ``sacred,'' products, and (3) how ritual merges the gap between the real and ideal.},

The natural features, in particular the hydrographic network and its evolution, are not described in them. Taking into account these facts, reconstituted on the basis of geomorphological and archaeological investigations, surveys in combination with a re-reading of the texts, considerably enriches the historical panorama. In this way, a reconstruction has been undertaken of the palaeo-fluviatile landscape of the region where Tigris and Euphrates definitively enter into the alluvial plain and which constitutes the key to the whole hydrological network of Sumer and Akkad. The project was subsequently extended to the south. The results are completely different from what has been accepted since fifty years. Furthermore, they are in complete accordance with an independent research on the region even further to the south. A new map of Mesopotamia is emerging with an interfluvial region much smaller and a Transtigridian one much larger than previously thought.},

Our survey of the contents of five top-tier business and economic history journals published in the United Kingdom and the United States from 2000 to 2016 finds that only 20 per cent of the articles concern the entire period before 1800 and that, among those articles, most are national or regional in scope, with a disproportionate focus on Europe, and on England in particular. At the same time, our survey suggests that a strong theoretical foundation and rich empirical data exist on the basis of which we can develop a comparative business history of the preindustrial world. We identify four areas of enquiry that are especially conducive to further comparisons within and beyond Europe: the corporation, the family firms, the economic role of women, and the funding of private businesses.},

We use exploratory data analysis to detect patterns, we select features, and we use them to evaluate classification models to predict new relations, to be recommended to archivists during the cataloguing phase. Results show that relations based on biographical information can be addressed with higher precision than relations based on research topics or institutional relations. Deterministic and a priori rules present better results than probabilistic methods.},

This volume explores how Syro-Hittite monumental art was used as a powerful backdrop to important ritual events, and it opens up a new perspective by situating the monumental heritage in the context of large public performances and civic spectacles of great emotional impact. The first part of the volume focuses on the sites of Carchemish and Zincirli, offering a close reading of the relevant archaeological contexts. The second part of the volume discusses the embedment of monumental art in ritual performance and examines how change in art relates to change in ceremonial behavior, and how the latter relates in turn to change in power structures and models of rulership.},

It can be consulted by undergraduate and post-graduate level students as well as instructors, researchers and professionals in archaeology. Each chapter tackles a specific technique or application area and follows a clear and coherent structure. First, is a richly referenced introduction to the particular technique, followed by a detailed description of the methodology, then an archaeological case-study to illustrate the application of the technique, and conclusions that point to the implications and potential of the technique within archaeology. The book is designed to function as the main textbook for archaeological spatial analysis courses at undergraduate and post-graduate level, while its user friendly structure makes it also suitable for self-learning by archaeology students as well as researchers and professionals"--},

Following this, we offer a brief historical overview of the development of spatial analysis in archaeology. This is then followed by a consideration of why concepts of space and spatiality underlie much archaeological thought, what can be called `spatial thinking' in archaeology, and how this relates to what is understood by `spatial analysis'. The chapter concludes with a careful consideration of what it means to think spatially in order to foreground the goal of the volume as a whole, which is to make a positive contribution to the on-going development of archaeological spatial literacy at a time of significant theoretical and methodological transformation.},

We begin with a brief outline of the ways in which visual characteristics have been integrated into archaeological studies, whether as properties of structures and/or locations or as embodied acts of looking and seeing. This is followed by a detailed technical discussion of the ways in which visibility can be analysed through GIS and the various models, representations and heuristics that are generated in the process; from simple line-of-sight determinations and binary (in-view or out-of-view) viewsheds to landscape-scale total viewsheds and visibility networks. A key argument is that whilst such visibility products offer useful interpretative potential in their own right, they can also serve as the starting point for a host of more complex, and potentially rewarding investigations. These can involve the careful extraction and interrogation of a range of descriptive properties (such as the shape, directionality and compactness of a given viewshed) as well as the exploration of more perceptual characteristics such as prominence and hiding. The chapter ends with the critical discussion of a practical case study that demonstrates how the approaches discussed can shed new light on the past.},

  abstract = {Hegemonic dominance relationships and the limited intentional material expressions of imperial power they usually encompass pose an interesting and well-known problem for the archaeology of early empires. One way of approaching domination in the archaeological record is through the synthetic analysis of different modes of imperial-local interaction at overlapping socio-political levels and spheres of culture. In this paper, four material culture categories are considered with the aim of characterizing Hittite imperial relationships in Late Bronze Age Anatolia and northern Syria. They include pottery traditions and their degree of susceptibility for central influence, diachronic settlement developments, the distribution of imperial administrative technology, and an ideological discourse carried out through landscape monuments. From the spatial and chronological signatures of these overlapping networks of interaction, a more nuanced understanding of the process of empire is beginning to emerge.},

  abstract = {Industrialization of the construction process is increasing around the world due to its potential to improve safety, sustainability, effectiveness, productivity and efficiency. While there has been research into the impacts of various forms of industrialized construction on the construction sector, surprisingly there has been little research into the impacts on subcontractors. The lack of subcontractor's voice in the industrialization debate is important to address since they operate at the coalface of the industry where the impacts of such changes will have a significant impact. The resource based view of the firm (RBV) is used as a theoretical lens to study these potential impacts through interviews with senior executives and managers of six major subcontracting firms which have worked with off-site bathroom pod technologies in Australia. It is found that the key subcontractor resources affected by this off-site technology are human, financial, intellectual and social and that subcontractors will need to pursue strategies which develop new skills, knowledge, networks and deeper supply chain collaborations if they are to turn the potential risks associated with off-site into potential opportunities to achieve competitive advantage.},

In addition, these tools allow us to visually preserve the features of archaeological sites for future use and facilitate the dissemination of archaeological heritage to local communities and the general public. This paper summarizes 3D photographic visualization of three cave art sites (Los Cayucos and Cueva No. 1 in Punta del Este, Cuba, and Jos{\'e} Mar{\'i}a Cave in the Dominican Republic) and two burial spaces (Can{\'i}mar Abajo and Playa del Mango, Cuba) using photogrammetry software. The application of these novel methods at the cave art sites allowed us to visualize faint pictographs that were invisible to the naked eye, to better define the shapes of petroglyphs and to reconstruct the position of lost/removed panels. At the burial sites, 3D modeling allowed us to register the archaeological context with greater precision. The use of 3D modeling will improve spatial analysis and data safeguarding in Cuban archaeology. Moreover, 3D movies are an effective way to disseminate knowledge and connect local communities with their cultural heritage, while reducing the impact of public visits to remote or endangered sites.},

  abstract = {In late first-millennium Akkadian names, the imperial deities of the Neo-Babylonian state were given preference over the ancient revered triad of the "great gods" Anu, Enlil, and Ea. Among these three gods, the cult of Enki/Ea is the most perplexing during this late period. On the one hand, his importance is attested in cult and ritual: Babylon contained numerous shrines to Ea, including a temple, the E-kar-zaginna, in the precinct of Marduk's great temple, the Esagil. On the other hand, he nearly vanishes from the onomasticon of given names, with the exception of some fossilized ancient family names and the personal names of close to two hundred individuals, mostly from the city of Babylon between the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar II and the thirty-second year of Darius I. This article traces the different forms of Ea worship reflected in literary and archival sources, as well as in name-giving practices. Its first part deals with the socio-religious interplay between S{\^i}n and Ea, which gave rise to the use of ancestral names in specific urban kinship groups that revered these deities. Beginning in the Old and Middle Babylonian periods, these families spread from Nippur and the south of Babylonia (i.e. the "Sealand") and eventually settled in Babylon and nearby cities, where we find many of them well established in the long sixth century (620--484 BCE). In the second part of the article I investigate several such families that exhibit consistent traits of Ea worship or a relation to Ea's cult across several generations.}

It argues that almost at the same time as when Athenian d{\=e}mokratia was developing, notions of a citizen body and claiming of rights -- what citizenship scholarship defines as `acts of citizenship' -- existed in Babylonia under the first world empires. It demonstrates that the Neo-Babylonian state, the emerging Athenian d{\=e}mokratia, and Rome before the Constitutio Antoniniana share aspects of citizenship acts: first, civic identity and prestige, based on a genealogical system of identification bound in legal terminology, as well as (active) involvement in cult; and second, institutionally bound privileges and obligations, which governed marriage, inheritance and certain economic activities, as well as certain duties towards urban and state institutions. Several case-studies are used to display these acts of citizenship: three-tier naming practices and use of gentilics, accumulation of power by urbanites through a structured set of practices, and acts of privilege provided by the state, or royal favour. It concludes with a comparative example of the boundaries of the rights of citizens: the rights of foreign women marrying into elite citizen families.},

  abstract = {The Late Bronze Age (ca. 1500-1200 BC) constitutes the heyday of the great empires of the ancient Near East (ANE), such as Egypt, Hatti, Mitanni, Babylonia, and Assyria. Centuries of conflicts followed by peaceful relations, marked the interrelations of these superpowers. Rich literary records in the form of archives of cuneiform texts were established. These archives contain abundant tablets whose origin is unknown. Sometimes the letterhead is missing, in other cases, we may have the name of the sender and still ignore his domicile. Further, the location of many ANE countries and cities has not yet been clearly established. Hence, revealing the origin of documents has the potential of shedding new light on the history of the ANE and beyond. The paper will discuss the use of a rich array of nondestructive testing (NDT) and minimally-destructive testing (MDT) methods for studying the composition, technology and provenance of ANE cuneiform tablets. This approach opens new horizons in the interpretation of the clay documents. We applied such analyses on hundreds of tablets from el Amarna, Ras Shamra/Ugarit, Bo{\u g}azk{\"o}y/Hattusha, and sites in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine. The research project made during the last decade, serves as the basis for this study. The results raise a set of ethical and practical issues concerning the study and conservation of such precious artifacts.}

These texts are characterized by varying amounts of Luwian and Hurrian elements and rites in them. This article, however, aims to foreground festival texts with connections to Kizzuwatna and adjacent regions, namely the ``Festival for Te{\v s}{\v s}ub and Ḫebat of Lawazantiya (CTH 699)'' and the ``Cults for Te{\v s}{\v s}ub and Ḫebat of Aleppo (CTH 698)''. Both festivals reveal very little Luwian, but they do exhibit obvious Hurrian influences. This article offers first thoughts toward an interpretation of the lack of Luwian in these texts, along with other texts with an alleged origin in Southeastern Anatolia or Northern Syria.},

  abstract = {Abstract Gog and Magog, the apocalyptic destroyers prophesied in the book of Revelations, gave concrete expression to the apocalyptic climate that dominated medieval thinking about the future-and the present. They permeated medieval texts and appeared in most maps of the world. Historians are coming to understand medieval and early modern world maps not primarily as rather primitive technical tools but as cultural documents. Such maps expressed in graphic form the world view(s) of medieval elites (princely, scholarly, mercantile). The traditional contents of mappaemundi and early printed maps place them firmly in the tradition of medieval learning, yet they show signs very early on of skeptical and "empirical" questioning directed at received (mainly ancient) wisdom concerning the existence, location, population, and qualities of traditional cartographic *topoi (e.g., the kingdom of Prester John). As Renaissance source-scholarship, rules of evidence, and overseas exploration reshaped cartography, world maps underwent both a rapid transformation into sources of up-to-date information and a certain retrenchment of traditional contents, especially in distant and marginal areas. Gog and Magog are among the principal remnants of the medieval dream of the world. They appear, often with reference to Marco Polo, on world maps well into the seventeenth century. Early modern Europeans continued to view much of the world through medieval lenses.},

However, our datasets are becoming increasingly large and complex as more and more data is generated (primarily) by commercial projects. If we define `Big Data' in this context as datasets that are too large to be collated and analysed without automated methods (within budget constraints), then we are beginning to see archaeological spatial analysis brush up against the shores of Big Data analytics. Within archaeology, these datasets fall broadly within two camps: (a) those with immense numbers of records but with simple numeric attributes (e.g. point clouds generated by LiDAR); and (b) those with lower numbers of records but complex numeric and textual attributes (e.g. catalogues of discoveries at national or international scales). This chapter is primarily concerned with the latter and will discuss methods which can be used to study these complex large datasets in their spatial context, using examples taken from the English Landscapes and Identities project which ended in 2016.},

Interest in historical GIS is not restricted to researchers who would previously have regarded themselves as historical geographers, but has in fact led to an increased awareness of the importance of geography from across the discipline of history.

Historical GIS introduces the basic concepts and tools underpinning GIS technology, describing and critically assessing the visualisation, analytical and e-science methodologies that it enables and examining key scholarship where GIS has been used to enhance research debates.

  abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse---definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects---is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

During this discussion, questions of modelling, linking, and visualising data from the humanities will be tackled as well. Finally, opportunities for further analysis and visualisation of semantically modelled data in the humanities are exemplarily presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The aims of XML data conversion to ontologies are the indexing, integration and enrichment of existing ontologies with knowledge acquired from these sources. The contribution of this paper consists in providing a classification of the approaches used for the conversion of XML documents into OWL ontologies. This classification underlines the usage profile of each conversion method, providing a clear description of the advantages and drawbacks belonging to each method. Hence, this paper focuses on two main processes, which are ontology enrichment and ontology population using XML data. Ontology enrichment is related to the schema of the ontology (TBox), and ontology population is related to an individual (Abox). In addition, the ontologies described in these methods are based on formal languages of the Semantic Web such as OWL (Ontology Web Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework). These languages are formal because the semantics are formally defined and take advantage of the Description Logics. In contrast, XML data sources are without formal semantics. The XML language is used to store, export and share data between processes able to process the specific data structure. However, even if the semantics is not explicitly expressed, data structure contains the universe of discourse by using a qualified vocabulary regarding a consensual agreement. In order to formalize this semantics, the OWL language provides rich logical constraints. Therefore, these logical constraints are evolved in the transformation of XML documents into OWL documents, allowing the enrichment and the population of the target ontology. To design such a transformation, the current research field establishes connections between OWL constructs (classes, predicates, simple or complex data types, etc.) and XML constructs (elements, attributes, element lists, etc.). Two different approaches for the transformation process are exposed. The instance approaches are based on XML documents without any schema associated. The validation approaches are based on the XML schema and document validated by the associated schema. The second approaches benefit from the schema definition to provide automated transformations with logic constraints. Both approaches are discussed in the text.},

  abstract = {While the epistemological affordances and varied impacts of different media on archaeological knowledge production have been scrutinized by many practitioners in recent decades, sources of digital structured data (e.g., spreadsheets, traditional relational databases, content management systems) have seen far less critical enquiry. Structured digital data are often venerated for their capacities to facilitate interoperability, equitable data exchange, democratic forms of engagement with, and widespread reuse of archaeological records, yet their constraints on our knowledge formation processes are arguably profound and deserving of detailed interrogation. In this article, we discuss what we call the emerging supremacy of structured digital data in archaeology and seek to question the consequences of their ubiquity. We ground our argument in a case study of a range of texts produced by practitioners working on the {\c C}atalh{\"o}y{\"u}k Research Project. We attempt to map short excerpts from these texts to structured data via the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. This exercise allows making preliminary observations about the representational affordances and resistances of texts (which can be considered as a type of semi- or unstructured data) and structured data. Ultimately, we argue that the push to create more and more structured and structurable data needs to be tempered by a more inclusive digital practice in archaeology that protects difference, incommensurability, and interpretative nuance.},

Analysis of new sources of declassified aerial and satellite imagery from the 1950s and 1960s, recent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos, and a systematic surface collection show that Ur may have expanded to between 120--500 hectares in size during its later periods of habitation, far larger than the sixty hectare maximum size previously estimated. Traces of buried architecture visible in the UAV photos and topographic models generated from UAV photos allow for the generation of hypotheses about the city plan of Ur during the Late Larsa/Old Babylonian and Neo Babylonian periods. Relict watercourses mapped in the vicinity of the main mound indicate how the city might have been supplied with water in some periods. Alongside this site-based work, historical aerial and satellite imagery provide an updated picture of ancient hydrology, environment, and settlement patterns around Ur.},

  abstract = {Recently declassified photographs taken by U2 spy planes in the 1950s and 1960s provide an important new source of historical aerial imagery useful for Eurasian archaeology. Like other sources of historical imagery, U2 photos provide a window into the past, before modern agriculture and development destroyed many archaeological sites. U2 imagery is older and in many cases higher resolution than CORONA spy satellite imagery, the other major source of historical imagery for Eurasia, and thus can expand the range of archaeological sites and features that can be studied from an aerial perspective. However, there are significant barriers to finding and retrieving U2 imagery of particular locales, and archaeologists have thus not yet widely used it. In this article, we aim to reduce these barriers by describing the U2 photo dataset and how to access it. We also provide the first spatial index of U2 photos for the Middle East. A brief discussion of archaeological case studies drawn from U2 imagery illustrates its merits and limitations. These case studies include investigations of prehistoric mass-kill hunting traps in eastern Jordan, irrigation systems of the first millennium BC Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Iraq, and twentieth-century marsh communities in southern Iraq., Las fotograf{\'i}as tomadas por aviones esp{\'i}a U-2 durante los a{\~n}os 50 y 60, recientemente desclasificadas, son una nueva fuente de im{\'a}genes a{\'e}reas muy {\'u}til para la arqueolog{\'i}a euroasi{\'a}tica.

  abstract = {Leveraging a suite of remote sensing technologies deployed over large areas, this paper presents results that challenge long-held ideas about the origin and development of the world's oldest urban centers, in southern Iraq. The standard model of third millennium BCE Mesopotamian cities presents them as nuclear, compact settlements set within an irrigated agricultural hinterland, expanding continuously from a monumental religious complex. This reconstruction holds enormous influence in the comparative global study of early urbanism. UAV photos and magnetic gradiometry data captured at Lagash (Tell al-Hiba) show dense architecture and related paleoenvironmental features over c. 300~ha, revealing a city that does not conform to the standard model. Early Dynastic Lagash (2900--2350 BCE) was composed of spatially discrete sectors bounded by multiple surrounding walls and/or watercourses and separated by open spaces. The evidence is suggestive of a marshy or watery local environment, and the city sectors may have originated as marsh islands. The discontinuous, walled nature of inhabited areas would have had social and logistical ramifications for city inhabitants. A number of contemporary sites are characterized by multiple archaeological mounds, suggesting that early southern Mesopotamian cities may have frequently been spatially multi-centric.},

As they are known for requiring large amounts of training data, there is a growing body of work to improve the performance in low-resource settings. Motivated by the recent fundamental changes towards neural models and the popular pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, we survey promising approaches for low-resource natural language processing. After a discussion about the different dimensions of data availability, we give a structured overview of methods that enable learning when training data is sparse. This includes mechanisms to create additional labeled data like data augmentation and distant supervision as well as transfer learning settings that reduce the need for target supervision. A goal of our survey is to explain how these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential for choosing a technique suited for a specific low-resource setting. Further key aspects of this work are to highlight open issues and to outline promising directions for future research.},

The work described in this paper extends this approach to the publication of gnomologia (anthologies of wise sayings) , which formed a widespread literary genre in many cultures of the medieval Mediterranean. These texts are challenging because they were rarely copied straightforwardly ; rather , sayings were selected , reorganised , modified or re-attributed between manuscripts , resulting in a highly interconnected corpus for which a standard approach to digital publication is insufficient. Focusing on Greek and Arabic collections , we address this challenge using semantic web techniques to create an ecosystem of texts , relationships and annotations , and consider a new model -- organic , collaborative , interconnected , and open-ended -- of what constitutes an edition. This semantic web-based approach allows scholars to add their own materials and annotations to the network of information and to explore the conceptual networks that arise from these interconnected sayings .}

  abstract = {Each model of past movement based on historical and archaeological evidence nowadays relies implicitly or explicitly on a cost function estimating costs of movement in terms of time, calories or some other currency for the study area and period of time considered. Cost functions are the basis of two popular GIS-based areas of spatial analysis in archaeology: site catchments and least-cost paths. A site catchment is the region accessible from a site, and often archaeological studies analyse the resources within this region. A least-cost path (LCP) is the route minimizing the costs of movement between two given locations. In archaeological studies, the aim of LCP calculations is often to reconstruct ancient routes or a route network or to identify the principal factors governing the construction of known roads or road segments. For generating a site catchment, GIS programs compute an accumulated cost surface (ACS). This is also the first step for LCP generation; therefore, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in most GIS programs for this purpose is outlined. The cost function applied for calculating the ACS typically depends on slope, soil type, vegetation cover or the presence of streams. Several slope-dependent cost functions and a list of terrain factors are presented. Moreover, issues with least-cost applications are discussed, including barrier implementation, restricted number of possible movement directions, and the calculation of slope-based costs for a path taken in one or two directions. The aim of the case study is to compare the site catchments of a Roman farm and a temple at different scales based on a cost model derived from Roman roads. The concluding section discusses validation and stability of the outcomes of the methods presented and some additional issues such as modelling movement beyond walking. Finally, some other cost function based approaches are outlined.},

Writing in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolutions and in the long shadow cast by the French Revolution of 1789, he observed the rise of industrial capitalism and mass politics with trepidation. He especially lamented the fate of the individual, whose creativity had shaped the glories of the Renaissance and ancient Greece but who was increasingly domesticated and commodified in modern society. Unlike conventional accounts, which characterize him as an apolitical aesthete, Hinde shows us that Burckhardt was as a thinker of profound importance whose conservative anti-modernism ranks him with his colleague Friedrich Nietzsche.},

The authors show how these techniques, when sensitively employed, can dramatically extend and refine the information presented in distribution maps and other analyses of spatial relationships. Techniques of interpretation 'by inspection' can now be made more powerful and rigorous; at the same time interest has turned from the examination of such sites and artefacts as 'things' to the spatial relationships between such things, their relationships to one another and to landscape features, soils and other resources. This book was the first to apply the available techniques systematically to the special problems and interests of archaeologists. It also demonstrates to geographers and other social scientists who may be familiar with analogous applications in their own fields the exciting interdisciplinary developments this facilitates, for example in studies of exchange networks, trade and settlement patterns, and cultural history.},

  abstract = {There is a long history of human--riverine interactions throughout the period of agriculture that in some regions of the world started several thousand years ago. These interactions have altered rivers to human dominated systems with often negative impacts on fluvial environments. To achieve a good ecological and chemical status of rivers, as intended in the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), a better understanding of the natural status of rivers and an improved quantification of human--riverine interactions is necessary. Over the last decade the PAGES-LUCIFS (Land Use and Climate Impact on Fluvial Systems) program has been investigating both contemporary and long-term (centuries to millennia) river responses to global change with the principal aims of: 1) quantifying land use and climate change impacts of river-borne fluxes of water, sediment, C, N and P; 2) identification of key controls on these fluxes at the catchment scale; and 3) identification of the feedback on both human society and biogeochemical cycles of long-term changes in the fluxes of these materials. Here, we review recent progress on identifying fluvial system baselines and quantifying the response of long-term sediment budgets, biogeochemical fluxes and flood magnitude and frequency to Holocene global change. Based on this review, we outline the future LUCIFS research agenda within the scope of the PAGES-PHAROS (Past Human-Climate-Ecological Interactions) research program. Key research strategies should be focused on: 1) synthesising the data available from existing case studies; 2) targeting research in data-poor regions; 3) integrating sediment, C, N and P fluxes; 4) quantifying the relative roles of allogenic and autogenic forcing on fluvial regimes, extreme events and sediment fluxes; 5) improving long-term river basin modelling; and 6) integration of LUCIFS with other research communities within PHAROS, namely HITE (land cover) and LIMPACS (water quality and biodiversity).},

  abstract = {Authorities and planners involved in river restoration projects often tend to focus on the hydromorphological state of a short river reach or certain aquatic habitats where the pending deficits are most evident. Nevertheless, for long-term and sustainable restoration, one should also consider flood dynamics and other interlinked processes at larger spatio-temporal scales, ideally at the catchment scale. Channel geometry and fluvial dynamics are not solely determined by local geomorphological framework conditions. Rather they are the product of influxes from the upstream catchment. Over the long term, both sediment transport and discharge, on the one side, and the local/sectional setting (e.g. geology, topography) on the other side lead to the formation of certain channel patterns. Changes in upstream sediment delivery and altered discharge regimes trigger local channel adjustments.Accordingly, channelization measures do not only affect the physical configuration and dynamic fluvial processes at a respective river reach. Rather they influence much longer river sections or even the whole river system, including the tributaries. Human interventions into riverine environments always call for consideration of unintended side effects and potential long-term legacies that may cause new problems at upstream or downstream sections. What seems to be clear for river channelization does also apply to restoration measures. Locally implemented river restoration projects may also influence the up- and downstream fluvial processes and, thus, the habitat availability and the ecological state of longer river sections.},

One theme in those debates has been how a comprehensive Mediterranean history can be written: how an approach to Mediterranean history by way of its ecologies and the communications between them can be joined up with more mainstream forms of enquiry - cultural, social, economic, and political, with their specific chronologies and turning points. The second theme raises the question of how Mediterranean history can be fitted into a larger, indeed global history. It concerns the definition of the Mediterranean in space, the way to characterise its frontiers, and the relations between the region so defined and the other large spaces, many of them oceans, to which historians have increasingly turned for novel disciplinary-cum-geographical units of study. A volume collecting the two authors' studies on both these themes, as well as their reply to critics of The Corrupting Sea, should prove invaluable to students and scholars from a number of disciplines: ancient, medieval and early modern history, archaeology, and social anthropology"},

This is partly for disciplinary reasons and partly for the technical reason that high-quality maps have not until recently been available digitally, geo-referenced, and in color. A final, and crucial, addition has been the creation of item-level metadata which allows map collections to become corpora which can for the first time be interrogated en masse as source material. By applying new Computer Vision methods leveraging machine learning, we outline a research pipeline for working with thousands (rather than a handful) of maps at once, which enables new forms of historical inquiry based on spatial analysis. Our `patchwork method' draws on the longstanding desire to adopt an overall or `complete' view of a territory, and in so doing highlights certain parallels between the situation faced by today's users of digitized maps, and a similar inflexion point faced by their predecessors in the nineteenth century, as the project to map the nation approached a form of completion.},

  abstract = {This study presents 32 high-resolution geomagnetic intensity data points from Mesopotamia, spanning the 3rd to the 1st millennia BCE. These data contribute to rectifying geographic disparities in the resolution of the global archaeointensity curve that have hampered our understanding of geomagnetic field dynamics and the viability of applying archaeomagnetism as a method of absolute dating of archaeological objects. A lack of precise and well-dated intensity data in the region has also limited our ability to identify short-term fluctuations in the geomagnetic field, such as the Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly (LIAA), a period of high field intensity from ca. 1050 to 550 BCE. This phenomenon has hitherto not been well-demonstrated in Mesopotamia, contrary to predictions from regional geomagnetic models. To address these issues, this study presents precise archaeomagnetic results from 32 inscribed baked bricks, tightly dated to the reigns of 12 Mesopotamian kings through interpretation of their inscriptions. Results confirm the presence of the high field values of the LIAA in Mesopotamia during the first millennium BCE and drastically increase the resolution of the archaeointensity curve for the 3rd--1st millennia BCE. This research establishes a baseline for the use of archaeomagnetic analysis as an absolute dating technique for archaeological materials from Mesopotamia.}

From the first aerial reconnaissance programs, archaeologists recognized the value of a view from above to address overarching human--environmental questions that underpin regional historical narratives. The diversity and density of visible remains in the landscape of the Middle East has required an integrative approach, encompassed in the perspective of landscape as a static artifact, landscape as built features, landscape as a system, and landscape as a dynamic construct, which cuts across modern political boundaries. Recent advances in geospatial tools and datasets have enabled archaeologists to make significant progress on four long-standing questions of how to (1) best document and manage rapidly disappearing ancient landscapes, (2) understand landscape formation processes, (3) identify and interpret economic, environmental, and social influences that result in long-term settlement and land use patterns, and (4) recognize and contextualize the interplay between environment and human agency in the evolution of ancient economies and transformations in socio-organizational complexity.},

Focusing on the area of the Hawr al-Hammar marshes, the authors conducted preliminary archaeological, geological and landscape investigation over the course of 18 days in the autumn of 2010, funded by a U.S. National Science Foundation High Risk Research in Physical Anthropology and Archaeology grant.},

Using southern Mesopotamia as a case study, this article addresses, both quantitatively and qualitatively, long-held assumptions concerning the nature and relationship of settlement patterns and river channel systems in antiquity. GIS and image analysis are used to fill in gaps in the settlement record and propose a revised location for the Tigris River during most of antiquity. Given that only one-third of the central alluvial plain had been ground surveyed in southern Mesopotamia, how complete was our picture of landscape and settlement? How could gaps in settlement be interpreted? The present work in the area east of Baghdad suggests that archaeologists and historians have underestimated the nature and movements of the Tigris River. Satellite imagery can help reveal the location of the Tigris River prior to its settling into its modern course, shedding light on its potential role in the rise of early Mesopotamian agricultural societies. The work presented here proposes a methodology for unweaving and mapping preserved pieces of ancient landscapes, addressing larger issues of human modification of the landscape.},

It argues that currently this area is under-theorised, under-represented, and under-valued, yet it is increasingly fundamental to the way in which we arrive at an understanding of the past.},

  abstract = {It is widely assumed that all irrigation systems must have constituted authority and that all large irrigation systems must have centralized authority. The small literature which tests these beliefs is reviewed, and the results of a systematic comparative study are presented. The concepts of "irrigation system," "irrigation system size," and "irrigation system structure of authority" are defined. Variables which measure these concepts are constructed, and measurements from a purposive sample are displayed. A handful of small irrigation systems without authority structures was found. An inspection of the data reveals no relationship between size and the structure of authority in systems ranging from 700 to 458,000 ha. Furthermore, an irrigation system of 458,000 ha is managed by farmers. Conclusions: (1) irrigation systems without constituted authority exist and (2) large systems do not require central authority.}

This essay utilizes the flood pulse concept and argues that the deterioration of comprehensive waterworks restored the natural unmodified flood regime of the Euphrates and reinvigorated different species and natural systems, particularly the Iraqi marshes and their biota. Vibrant and reviving, marshes provided the material basis for the rise of the Khaz{\=a}ʿil tribal confederation to political dominance in Iraq's Middle Euphrates region at the turn of the eighteenth century and served it as an ecological niche and political ally during its struggle with the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman provincial authorities in Baghdad repeatedly dammed the Middle Euphrates and drained its marshes in order to break the basis of the Khaz{\=a}ʿil's power in the countryside. Ottoman hydraulic warfare weakened their tribal foes, but it produced unexpected outcomes in the long term that changed the history of the Ottoman Empire and its Iraqi provinces forever. Most notably, it facilitated a westward channel shift in the Euphrates and the consolidation of Shiʿism as a majority religion in the region.},

Scholars in the past century have combined material with textual evidence to capture the complexity of this sedimentary context and assess its role in human history over the long term. This essay uses untapped archival sources generated by the Ottoman Empire to shine a new light on the subject, emphasizing the impact of sedimentation on irrigation agriculture and channel movement during the early modern period. Ottoman documents, moreover, improve our understanding of how states and societies adapted to the opportunities and challenges provided by sediment transport. In their capacity as giant conduits for sedimentary movement, the Tigris and Euphrates formed selective pressures on the Ottoman state in Iraq that shaped and was reshaped by it. For the study of river systems worldwide, the early modern history of the Tigris and Euphrates reveals the utility of taking fluvial sediment into account when analyzing other hydrological processes such as avulsion.},

This conventional methodology requires enormous amounts of time and manual work. Here is proposed a new method that does not require these preprocessing steps, enabling the establishment of quantitative relationships using manuscript transcriptions only. This is achieved by applying a technique called shingling, where the manuscript transcriptions are turned in a computerized manner into smaller pieces called tokens or k-grams. Then, a string metric is used to calculate the similarities between the tokenized strings. This method is efficient, meaning that it allows critics to consider all textual evidence in each manuscript tradition. At the same time, it returns similarity values that are compatible with those of conventional approaches.},

  abstract = {Fluvial avulsion is an important process in the dynamics of the riverscapes and plays a key role in the drainage network evolution in lowland areas, also influencing past and present social processes and economic activities. Crevasse splays represent significant geomorphological features for understanding the fluvial morphodynamics in lowland areas dominated by avulsion processes. Within wide floodplains characterized by very low elevation ranges, the detection and accurate mapping of crevasse splay morphology and features, such as crevasse channels, levees, and deposit, can be very challenging considering floodplain extension, anthropic impact on the natural channels network, logistic difficulties, and in some cases, climate conditions that prevent field work. This research aims at improving the detection and mapping of crevasse splays in lowland areas through the combination of different remote sensing techniques based on optical multispectral imagery and topographic data derived from satellite earth observation missions. The Lower Mesopotamia Plain (LMP) offers a unique opportunity to study the avulsion processes because it presents numerous examples of crevasse splays, characterized by different sizes and states of activity. Furthermore, in this area, a strong correlation exists between the formation and development of crevasse splays and the expansion of agriculture and early societies since the Early Holocene. Different supervised classification (SC) methods of Landsat 8 satellite images have been tested together with topographic analysis of the microrelief, carried out based on two different 1-arcsec DEMs (AW3D30 and GDEM2). The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of multispectral imagery analysis and topographic analysis of the microrelief is useful for discerning different crevasse elements, distinguishing between active and relict landforms. The methodological approach proved helpful for improving the mapping of erosional and depositional landforms generated by the avulsion process and, in the study area, provided the best results for the active landforms.},

  abstract = {Since the foundations of international cataloguing standards were laid in 1971, a host of unforeseen factors have had a dramatic impact on libraries, forcing them to rethink their cataloguing policy.The automated processing of bibliographic data has become commonplace, while new modes of electronic publishing are developed every day. The rise of databases compiled on an international scale raises the problem of how to create codes and systems capable of being used in all countries concerned. Finally, financial pressures have forced many libraries to do more \&quot;minimal level\&quot; cataloguing to keep pace with the growth of publishing output.Adopting a user-focused approach, this study systematically defines what information library patrons and staff, publishers, distributors, and retailers expect to find. The wide range of contexts in which data is used -- from purchasing, cataloguing, and interlibrary loan to reference and preservation -- receives careful consideration.The model set forth here will serve as a welcome starting point to those charged with designing cataloguing codes and systems to suit our constantly evolving information environment.}

  abstract = {Definition of FRBRoo: A Conceptual Model for Bibliographic Information in Object-Oriented Formalism by Working Group on FRBR/CRM Dialogue FRBRoo FRBRoo FRBROO is an ontology or high-level conceptual model for bibliographic data. It is described in the document: Definition of FRBROO : a Conceptual Model for Bibliographic Information in Object-Oriented Formalism Version 2.4: [PDF -- English -- 4MB] Commonly known as FRBROO, this model is closely related to IFLA's FRBR family of conceptual models. It is the object-oriented version of these models. FRBROO version 1 was based on FRBR alone, while FRBROO version 2 is based on the three models: FRBR, FRAD and FRSAD. FRBROO remains true to the original models. It does not change the concepts expressed in the original three models, nor does it transform any aspect. It provides an alternative view or interpretation of the FRBR family of models. It is an object-oriented model, that is, the ontology described in FRBROO uses an object oriented formalism instead of entity-relationship modelling. Thus, FRBROO is better suited for the implementation of FRBR concepts in object oriented tools. It also makes explicit some concepts that were implicit in the original models, thus making it easier to move from conceptual model to real-life applications. Relationship between the library and museum conceptual models FRBROO is the result of dialogue between the conceptual modelling communities of IFLA and the International Council of Museums (ICOM).  The International Committee for Documentation is the ICOM committee involved in this work; it is known as CIDOC, from the acronym of the Committee's name in French. While the library community was developing the original FRBR entity-relationship model, the museum community was developing its own conceptual model for museum data: the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, or CIDOC CRM. When the two models were completed, each community recognized the great value in harmonizing the two models to support future data integration and interoperability. A common view of cultural heritage information benefits both communities. Purpose The purposes of FRBROO (also described in more detail in the introduction, section 1.1): To reach a common view of cultural heritage information through the harmonization of the high-level conceptual models of the library and museum communities To verify the internal consistency of the FRBR family of models by expressing these models using a different formalism or methodology To enable interoperability of data between the library and museum domains by having a shared ontology, and thus also supporting the integration and exchange of data from these two domains in applications, discovery and navigation tools, portals, etc. To fine-tune the conceptual models of each community through the modelling work required to achieve harmonization: the work involved in harmonization deepened both communities' understanding of issues that may have been overlooked during initial development To extend the scope of the FRBR family of models beyond the library domain and to extend the scope of the museum community's model to include bibliographic information: The harmonisation between the two models is also an opportunity to extend the scope of the CIDOC CRM to bibliographic information, which paves the way for extensions to other domains and formats, such as EAD, TEI, MPEG7, just to name a few. Consequently, it also extends the scope of the FRBR family of conceptual models to cultural materials, since FRBROO inherits all concepts of the CIDOC CRM, and opens the way for the IFLA models to benefit from further extensions of the scope of CIDOC CRM, such as the scientific heritage of observations and experiments. (Introduction, 1.1.5) Authorship and endorsement FRBROO was prepared by the Working Group on FRBR/CRM Dialogue (which is also referred to as: International Working Group on FRBR and CIDOC CRM Harmonisation). The Working Group is affiliated with the IFLA FRBR Review Group and works in consultation with the IFLA FRBR Review Group and with the ICOM CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group. The Working Group has both IFLA and ICOM members. FRBROO version 2.4 is endorsed by the IFLA Professional Committee},

  abstract = {Gephi is a network visualization software used in various disciplines (social network analysis, biology, genomics{\dots}). One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

  abstract = {The area of the El Kowm oasis in the centre of today's Syria is a unique showcase of Middle Eastern prehistory not only for its geographic position within the Arabian Desert, but also for the depth of its history. In fact the core area, about a dozen kilometres across, with the numerous natural springs were an important attractor for game and humans, visiting regularly this region since more than 1.8 million years. All over the periods, from the Lower Palaeolithic to the arrival of farmers, definitely arid conditions prevailed, perfectly showing human adaption to this particular environment, as has been clearly demonstrated by several extensive excavations of exceptionally rich Palaeolithic sites. Exceptional preservation conditions due to a particular geological setting in the context of active or dry springs offer an extraordinary resolution of human behaviour within a limited landscape during the complete period of the Pleistocene, illustrating cognitive capacities of early man to cope readily with arid environments, challenge the migration routes proposed by Out of Africa diffusion models, typically considered to be corridors with a superior environmental potential. R{\'e}sum{\'e} La r{\'e}gion de l'oasis d'El Kowm, dans le centre de la Syrie actuelle, est un exemple unique pour la Pr{\'e}-histoire du Proche-Orient. Ceci non seulement en raison de son emplacement dans le d{\'e}sert d'Arabie, mais aussi pour la dur{\'e}e de son histoire. En effet, {\`a} peine d'une douzaine de kilom{\`e}tres de diam{\`e}tre, la r{\'e}gion de l'oasis avec ses nombreuses sources naturelles {\'e}tait un point d'attraction pour les animaux et les humains qui sont revenus r{\'e}guli{\`e}rement dans cette r{\'e}gion depuis plus de 1,8~millions d'ann{\'e}es.

  abstract = {This article describes the development and application of an innovative tool, Text Re-use Alignment Visualization (TRAViz), whose aim is to visualize variation between editions of both historical and modern texts. Reading different editions of a text empowers research in literary studies and linguistics, where one can study a text's reception or follow the development of its language over time. One of the purposes of a text edition is to trace or reconstruct a possible archetype or something that might be considered to be an original version of the text in order to better understand its evolution over time. To do so, the textual scholar examines and records the similarities and the differences between a number of exemplars in what is known as a `critical apparatus'. The result of this variant analysis can be visually represented as a `Variant Graph', where the relationships between these exemplars can be more easily studied. Variant Graphs can be, in turn, visualized in order to facilitate reading and interaction with the source data. Borrowing from existing digital tools, TRAViz assists the scholar in the collation process by specifically focusing on design and user engagement, concurrently seeking to simplify interaction as a means of encouraging humanists to adopt the tool. The article will describe the needs and rationale behind the creation of TRAViz by exploring existing research, describing its functionality through examples, and by finally discussing how its application can influence future development of this tool in particular and of the field in general.},

It is characterized by frequent reoccurrence of similar pieces of text on various levels (from entire poems, through passages to single verses and collocations). However, finding these similarities is challenging due to a high degree of orthographical, morphological, and compositional variation. In this article, we propose a method for automatically identifying equivalent verses, i.e. verses conveying the same meaning with the same words, using a clustering based on cosine similarity of character bigram vectors. The method achieves around 81\% F-score and has been successfully used for identifying similarities across the entire SKVR corpus on the level of verse, passage, and poem. The results can be browsed through a Web interface.},

  abstract = {In dieser Dissertation werden die verschiedenen Aspekte der institutionellen Landwirtschaft des Eanna-Tempels in der s{\"u}d-babylonischen Stadt Uruk im ersten Jahrtausend vor Christus untersucht. Als Prim{\"a}rquellen wurden die neubabylonischen Keilschrifttafeln, die aus dem Archiv des Eanna-Tempels stammen, verwendet. Das Archiv deckt einen Zeitraum von etwa 615  v. Chr. bis 522 v. Chr. und gibt somit den Zeitrahmen dieser Studie vor. Die uruk{\"a}ische Landwirtschaft wird in Bezug auf die Organisation der Bewirtschaftung von Tempell{\"a}ndereien und insbesondere das sogenannte Generalpacht-System untersucht. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus werden die Pachtvertr{\"a}ge, die Topographie und die Tempell{\"a}ndereien in und um die Stadt Uruk erforscht. Folglich gliedert sich diese Studie in f{\"u}nf Teile: 1. Einleitung, 2. Organisation der Arbeit, 3. Pachtvertr{\"a}ge, 4. Aspekte der uruk{\"a}ischen Topographie, und 5. Zusammenfassung. Dies wird durch eine Reihe von Anh{\"a}ngen mit Text-Editionen, einer Rekonstruktion des landwirtschaftlichen Kalenders und Textkatalogen erg{\"a}nzt. Nach einer allgemeinen Einleitung folgt der zweite Teil (Organisation der Arbeit), der sich mit der Entwicklung der Tempellandwirtschaft beginnend mit der Phase vor der Einf{\"u}hrung der Generalpacht befasst. Die Organisation und die Aufgaben der verschiedenen landwirtschaftlichen Berufe wie Pfl{\"u}ger, Teilp{\"a}chter, G{\"a}rtner, und einer ganzen Reihe von Aufsehern wird ausf{\"u}hrlich behandelt. Die einzelnen Kapitel werden zum Teil durch prosopographische Tabellen erg{\"a}nzt.  Der Abschnitt {\"u}ber das Generalpacht-System befasst sich vornehmlich mit den Karrieren der einzelnen Personen, die als Generalp{\"a}chter belegt sind, und mit der Entwicklung dieses Systems. Bisher unver{\"o}ffentlichte Texte verbessern unsere Kenntnis dieses ausf{\"u}hrlich untersuchten Ph{\"a}nomens. Vor allem das private Archiv des Generalp{\"a}chters Shum-ukin, welches durch eine betr{\"a}chtliche Anzahl von nicht publizierten Texten erg{\"a}nzt werden konnte, wirft neues Licht auf seine soziale Herkunft, seine wirtschaftlichen T{\"a}tigkeiten und die Anf{\"a}nge seiner Karriere. Fragen bez{\"u}glich des Erfolges des Generalpacht-Systems sowie der Einmischung der k{\"o}niglichen Administration in die Organisation der Tempellandwirtschaft werden er{\"o}rtert. Die Rolle der Generalp{\"a}chter wird in Bezug auf die wichtigsten strukturellen Schw{\"a}chen des Eanna-Tempels, n{\"a}mlich Mangel an Arbeitskr{\"a}ften und Kapital, diskutiert. Der dritte Teil besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit den Pachtvertr{\"a}gen, mit ihren formalen Aspekten, der Typologie und der Terminologie. Eine beachtliche Anzahl von bisher unver{\"o}ffentlichten Texten (zwanzig von insgesamt vierzig vorhandenen Pachtvertr{\"a}gen) konnte identifiziert werden. Dadurch wird unser Wissen {\"u}ber diese Gruppe von Texten deutlich verbessert. Der Nutzen einer Analyse der zeitlichen Verteilung dieser Vertr{\"a}ge f{\"u}r das Verst{\"a}ndnis der landwirtschaftlichen Strategien des Eanna-Tempels wird er{\"o}rtert. Der topographische Teil gibt einen {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber die allgemeine geographische Lage im Umland von Uruk sowie {\"u}ber die bedeutenderen L{\"a}ndereien des Tempels. Als Ausgangspunkt f{\"u}r diese Darstellung dienen die Gew{\"a}sser, rund um welche die Felder und G{\"a}rten des Tempels angeordnet waren. Eine Reihe von Katastertexten wird vorgestellt und deren Sitz im Leben wird diskutiert. Unterschiedliche Formen der Landnutzung und die Gr{\"o}{\ss}e und Produktivit{\"a}t der Grundst{\"u}cke werden ebenfalls untersucht. Dies, zusammen mit den Hinweisen aus Pachtvertr{\"a}gen, erm{\"o}glicht uns {\"U}berlegungen zur Gesamtgr{\"o}{\ss}e der Tempell{\"a}ndereien und des Einkommens des Tempels in Naturalien anzustellen.   In den allgemeinen abschlie{\ss}enden Bemerkungen wird die Organisation der Arbeit und das landwirtschaftliche Regime des Eanna-Tempels mit der Situation in anderen babylonischen Institutionen und Regionen verglichen. Trotz vieler struktureller {\"A}hnlichkeiten ergeben sich hier auch deutliche Unterschiede bez{\"u}glich der Entwicklung und des Regimes von Eannas Landwirtschaft, vor allem etwa im Vergleich zum Ebabbar-Tempel in Nord-Babylonien. Die besonderen Umst{\"a}nde, vornehmlich die isolierte Lage des Tempels am Rand des babylonischen Reiches, die zu dieser speziellen Entwicklung der Landwirtschaft von Eanna gef{\"u}hrt haben, werden abschlie{\ss}end dargelegt.},

  abstract = {River deltas are dynamic systems whose channels can widen, narrow, migrate, avulse, and bifurcate to form new channel networks through time. With hundreds of millions of people living on these globally ubiquitous systems, it is critically important to understand and predict how delta channel networks will evolve over time. Although much work has been done to understand drivers of channel migration on the individual channel scale, a global-scale analysis of the current state of delta morphological change has not been attempted. In this study, we present a methodology for the automatic extraction of channel migration vectors from remotely sensed imagery by combining deep learning and principles from particle image velocimetry (PIV). This methodology is implemented on 48 river delta systems to create a global dataset of decadal-scale delta channel migration. By comparing delta channel migration distributions with a variety of known external forcings, we find that global patterns of channel migration can largely be reconciled with the level of fluvial forcing acting on the delta, sediment flux magnitude, and frequency of flood events. An understanding of modern rates and patterns of channel migration in river deltas is critical for successfully predicting future changes to delta systems and for informing decision makers striving for deltaic resilience.},

  abstract = {Scholars generally assume that Assyria employed a luni-solar calendrical system during the Middle Assyrian period---akin to the one used in Babylonia---that kept the months of its year synchronized with the seasons of the solar year through periodic intercalation. With this understanding, the regnal dates assigned to the Middle Assyrian kings have traditionally been expressed in terms of solar years. The present article, however, argues that the Assyrians did not use this type of system. The author draws upon a variety of administrative tablets---primarily from the reigns of Shalmaneser I, Tukult{\=i}-Ninurta I, and Tiglath-pileser I---to demonstrate that the months of the Assyrian year were in fact not permanently affixed to particular seasons of the solar year, revealing that its year was not intercalated and was thus perpetually rotating slowly through the solar year. This article also explores how such a calendrical system impacts the Middle Assyrian kings' regnal dates, which would need to be lowered given that the unadjusted Assyrian lunar year was slightly shorter than its solar counterpart.},

  abstract = {Inspired by Christopher Alexander's conception of the world -- space is not lifeless or neutral, but a living structure involving far more small things than large ones -- a topological representation has been previously developed to characterize the living structure or the wholeness of geographic space. This paper further develops the topological representation and living structure for predicting human activities in geographic space. Based on millions of street nodes of the United Kingdom extracted from OpenStreetMap, we established living structures at different levels of scale in a nested manner. We found that tweet locations at different levels of scale, such as country and city, can be well predicted by the underlying living structure. The high predictability demonstrates that the living structure and the topological representation are efficient and effective for better understanding geographic forms. Based on this major finding, we argue that the topological representation is a truly multiscale representation, and point out that existing geographic representations are essentially single scale, so they bear many scale problems such as modifiable areal unit problem, the conundrum of length and the ecological fallacy. We further discuss on why the living structure is an efficient and effective instrument for structuring geospatial big data, and why Alexander's organic worldview constitutes the third view of space.},

Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture. Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the "close-reading" of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

Unlike other efforts on the subject, MusicOWL provides a comprehensive vocabulary for annotating music scores, which covers important music-related information, such as melodies, dynamics, and tonalities. We also report on the Linked Music Score dataset creation, including all necessary steps from scanned music scores to RDF triples, and how this linked music score data enables users to search for music scores by using handy queries, thus translating the needs of many music professionals, data curators and online learners. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the search engine WWU Music Score Portal, which uses the approach proposed in this work to improve music scores discovery and support online learning of music.},

The Sharing Ancient Wisdoms (SAWS) project applies linked data practices to enhance and expand on what is possible with these digital text editions. Focussing on Greek and Arabic collections of ancient wise sayings, which are often related to each other, we use RDF to annotate and extract semantic information from the TEI documents as RDF triples. This allows researchers to explore the conceptual networks that arise from these interconnected sayings. The SAWS project advocates a semantic-web-based methodology, enhancing rather than replacing current workflow processes, for digital humanities researchers to share their findings and collectively benefit from each other's work.},

  abstract = {This study presents the results of the first remote sensing survey of hollow ways in Southern Mesopotamia between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, primarily using the imagery in Google Earth. For archaeologists, hollow ways are important trace fossils of past human movement that inform about how people travelled in the past and what considerations were important to them as they moved through the landscape. In this study, remotely sensed hollow ways were ground-truthed and dated by association with both palaeochannels and known archaeological sites. Contextual and morphological evidence of the hollow ways indicate that they are likely the archaeological manifestation of ethnographically attested ``water channels'' formed through the dense reeds of marshlands in southern Iraq, not formed by traction overland like other known hollow ways. The map itself documents the first known hollow ways preserved underwater and one of the best-preserved landscapes of past human movement in the Near East.},

This book, to put it plainly, is concerned with the things that the author of a technical article knows, but isn't saying. Like any field, mathematics operates under a regime of shared assumptions, and it is our purpose to elucidate some of those assumptions for the newcomer. The individual subjects we tackle are (in order): logic and proof, discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, probability and statistics, calculus, and differential equations},

The argument is informed by our current understanding of the performance of Babylonian commodity markets, for which abundant quantitative information is available.

In the first section are three "Opening Lectures," by Hans Neumann on Mesopotamian society at the turn of the 3rd millennium B.C.; by Adelheid Otto on archaeological perspectives on private and state in the second millennium B.C.; and by Michael Jursa on the state and its subjects during Neo-Babylonian times.

Allusion to the event is found in Isaiah, Kings, and Chronicles, but there is no correlation between the Assyrian and biblical descriptions of the same event. Dan'el Kahn offers a text-critical analysis of these biblical passages that allude to the military events. Detecting repetitions, breaks in the narrative, and contradictions and inconsistencies in the texts, he traces and reconstructs different and discrete sources. Kahn demonstrates that the biblical passages are based on earlier sources that were later edited and revised by a third hand.

  abstract = {``Climb!'' is a musical composition that combines the ideas of a classical virtuoso piece and a computer game. We present a case study of the composition process and realization of ``Climb!'', written for Disklavier and a digital interactive engine, which was co-developed together with the musical score. Specifically, the engine combines a system for recognising and responding to musical trigger phrases along with a dynamic digital score renderer. This tool chain allows for the composer's original scoring to include notational elements such as trigger phrases to be automatically extracted to auto-configure the engine for live performance. We reflect holistically on the development process to date and highlight the emerging challenges and opportunities. For example, this includes the potential for further developing the workflow around the scoring process and the ways in which support for musical triggers has shaped the compositional approach.},

It is argued that since the emergence of the capitalist firm (factory) in the British Industrial Revolution this co-evolutionary process has brought about two major mutant-forms, namely the M-form which emerged from the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution and the decentralized-disintegrated organization (project-based form) born in the ICT revolution. This paper analyzes the rise of the succeeding mutant-forms in the co-evolutionary process framework and also highlights the nature of the differences between them.JEL Codes: D20, O30, P12},

Alternate abstract: Kizzuwatnean rituals occupy an important place among the Hittite magical rituals. These rituals are encountered in Hittite archives since the Middle Hittite period. Kizzuwatna is a transitional and a culturally diverse region because of its geographical location. This cultural diversity reveals itself in Hittite magical rituals. The region is home to Hurrian and Luwian communities. The two Kizzuwatnean rituals presented in this study are Hurrian and Luwian rituals. The first of these rituals, the {\v S}ala{\v s}u Ritual is Hurrian, meaning that the incantations recited in the ritual are in Hurrian language. Some of the Hurrian passages are relatively easy to understand due to the existence of a Hurrian-Hittite bilingual copy of the incantations (KBo 19.145). The remaining incantations exist in monolingual Hurrian copies (e.g. KBo 11.19) and are much more difficult to interpret. The {\v S}ala{\v s}u Ritual also featured cultural elements of the Mesopotamian region, demonstrating the cultural diversity of the Kizzuwatna region. The second ritual treated in this study, the Kuwatalla Ritual ({\v s}alli aniur), is a Luwian ritual, i.e. written in Hittite but with Luwian incantations. The ritual contains two separate sub-rituals (hit. katta walḫuwa{\v s}/luw. dupadupar{\v s}a and ḫalliyattanza). The Kuwatalla ritual may be identified as Kizzuwatnean because of some of the elements it contains. The study concludes with a general comparison of the dominant ritual practices in these two rituals belonging to the same region, but to two distinct cultural traditions.},

  abstract = {TOWARDS ORGANIZING AND RETRIEVING CLASSICAL MUSIC BASED ON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS (FRBR) Sung-Min Kim, PhD University of Pittsburgh, 2015 Music is one of the most popular categories in general public's Web search. Compared to other types of information retrieval, music search requires a different approach. This is due to the fact that music information includes many unique elements such as composers, performers, instruments, and various media formats, which could make it difficult for the users to realize that there may be related or even duplicated music information available in a different format. Therefore, the methods of organization and presentation for music information become significant in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is considered an effective model for representing the relationships between musical works and organizing the information of musical works. The goals of this dissertation are twofold. First, I adopted FRBR as a model to represent classical music and propose additional attributes and relationships through user studies to enrich music information for users. Second, I examined, through user studies, how the FRBR model improves MIR compared to existing keyword-based retrieval methods. In order to achieve these two goals, three phases of studies are designed. The first phase examined users' perspectives toward FRBR representation and elicited their views on the importance of certain attributes and relationships in describing bibliographic records of classical music work. Phase 2 involved a content analysis of Web users' questions regarding classical music information obtained from Yahoo! Answers, which aimed to further understand Web users' information needs for classical music information and to examine whether the FRBR- v based classical music representation is adequate for satisfying those needs. The third phase examined users' retrieval performance and perceptions with FRBR-based music retrieval in comparison with FRBR-like search method using objective and subjective measures that are based on usability characteristics. This study has two primary contributions. First, it proposed an extended FRBR-based classical music representation model, CMFRBR, which was derived through interaction with music experts, information experts, and general music seekers. Second, it examines user experiences and system performance of classical music information retrieval using CMFRBR based search system compared to FRBR-like music retrieval system on the Web in multiple dimensions. vi TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION ................................................................................................................ 1 1.1 Motivation of the Study ....................................................................................... 1 1.2 Focus of the Study ................................................................................................ 4 1.3 Research Design ................................................................................................... 5 1.3.1 Research Questions.......................................................................................... 6 1.3.2 Research Plan ................................................................................................... 7 1.4 Terminology ....................................................................................................... 11 1.4.1 Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) .................. 12 1.4.2 Music Information Retrieval ........................................................................ 15 2 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE .................................................................................. 16 2.1 FRBR as a Conceptual Model of Cataloging System ..................................... 16 2.1.1 Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ................................ 16 2.1.2 Research on FRBR ........................................................................................ 20 2.2 FRBR as Music Information Representation Method ................................... 25 2.2.1 FRBR-Based Music Representation ............................................................ 25 2.2.2 Variations Projects ........................................................................................ 30 2.3 Music Information Retrieval ............................................................................ 33 2.3.1 Metadata Based Music Information Retrieval ........................................... 33 2.3.2 Music Information Retrieval on the Web .................................................... 34 2.4 Summary ............................................................................................................ 36 3 PHASE 1: Finding the Appropriate Attributes and Relationships of FRBR Entities for Classical Music ............................................................................................................................ 37 3.1 Introduction........................................................................................................ 37 3.2 Finding Important Attributes and Relationships in Music FRBR ............... 38 3.2.1 Selection of Attributes of an Entity and Relationships .............................. 38 3.2.2 Survey Design ................................................................................................. 40 3.2.3 Participants .................................................................................................... 41 3.3 Survey Results .................................................................................................... 42 3.3.1 Participants' Background and Music Search Experience ......................... 42 3.3.2 Rating the Importance of Attributes ........................................................... 43 vii 3.3.3 Relationship Representation ......................................................................... 47 3.4 Findings .............................................................................................................. 49 3.5 Discussion ........................................................................................................... 50 4 PHASE 2: Analyzing Use of FRBR with Finding Classical Music Information from Social Q\&A Sites ......................................................................................................................... 54 4.1 Finding FRBR Attributes and Relationships in Yahoo!

Historical GIS is the use of geographic information systems software and allied geospatial methods for historical research and teaching. Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are Changing Historical Scholarship offers case studies and essays on key issues involving historical GIS, highlighting the unprecedented range of tools to visualize historical information in a geographical context. Quantitative social science historians are embracing GIS to facilitate the mapping of large datasets, but anyone with access to the software and the skills to use it can include mapping in research. This change is little short of revolutionary considering how few scholars or students made maps even ten years ago. Historical maps are suddenly in great demand as digitally modified, georeferenced images that enable researchers to study GIS as a visual medium of communication and analysis.},

  abstract = {In the previous chapter Information Algebra, an algebraic structure capturing the idea that pieces of information refer to precise questions and that they can be combined and focussed on other questions is presented and discussed. A prototype of such information algebras is relational algebra. But also various kind of logic systems induce information algebras. In this chapter, this framework will be used to study uncertain information. It is often the case that a piece of information is known to be valid under certain assumptions, but it is not altogether sure that these assumptions really hold. Varying the assumptions leads to different information. Given such an uncertain body of information, assumption-based reasoning permits to deduce certain conclusions or to prove certain hypotheses under some assumptions. This kind of assumption-based inference can be carried further if the varying likelihood of different assumptions is described by a probability measure on the assumptions. Then, it is possible to measure the degree of support of a hypothesis by the probability that the assumptions supporting the hypothesis hold. A prototype system of such a probabilistic argumentation system based on propositional logic is described in [3]. Another example will be described in Section 2 of this chapter. It is shown that this way to model uncertain information leads to a theory which generalizes the well-known Dempster-Shafer theory [6, 19].},

Witchcraft is an intensely emotional crime, rooted in the belief that envy and spite can cause illness or even death. Witch-trials in turn are emotionally driven by the grief of alleged victims and by the fears of magistrates and demonologists. With examples ranging from Russia to New England, Germany to Cameroon, chapters cover the representation of emotional witches in demonology and art; the gendering of witchcraft as female envy or male rage; witchcraft as a form of bullying and witchcraft accusation as a form of therapy; love magic and demon-lovers; and the affective memorialization of the "Burning Times" among contemporary Pagan feminists. Wide-ranging and methodologically diverse, the book is appropriate for scholars of witchcraft, gender, and emotions; for graduate or undergraduate courses, and for the interested general reader},

This article then explores this dynamic further, focusing on the use of administrative information as a point of imperial contestation, examining issues of local control and clashing hierarchies as the shepherds served an imperial obligation in the Mesopotamian hinterland, and finally argues that the pastoral dynamic presented here is of a piece with the larger political role of the temple in Babylonian life---both urban, familiar, and central and at the same time distant, other-like, and enigmatic.}

The administrative archives of those temples -- consisting of tens of thousands of cuneiform texts -- allow us to understand parts of the temple economy in great detail, while at the same time this abundance of material frustrates traditional approaches to Babylonian religion. This essay aims in general to emphasize that Babylonian temples were large-scale, multifaceted religious institutions. Capitalizing on recent advancements in our technical understanding of the temple economy, it integrates these advancements into issues of broader religious, historical, intellectual, and economic significance. In particular, it stresses three points: first, the temples' amalgamated ruling structure fostered institutional permanence and should therefore be understood as a challenge to the `temple-as-household' metaphor; second, large-scale centralization of wealth in the temples was necessary for advancements in Babylonian learned culture (especially in astronomy and mathematics); and, finally, the centralization of manpower in the temples gave them particular advantages in the politics of the first millennium bc. In the end, I argue that all of these are in fact manifestations of Babylonian religion in themselves.},

A tremendous number of cuneiform tablets have already been discovered and are incrementally digitalized and made available to automated processing. As reading cuneiform script is still a manual task, we address the real-world application of recognizing cuneiform signs by two graph based methods with complementary runtime characteristics. We present a graph model for cuneiform signs together with a tailored distance measure based on the concept of the graph edit distance. We propose efficient heuristics for its computation and demonstrate its effectiveness in classification tasks experimentally. To this end, the distance measure is used to implement a nearest neighbor classifier leading to a high computational cost for the prediction phase with increasing training set size. In order to overcome this issue, we propose to use CNNs adapted to graphs as an alternative approach shifting the computational cost to the training phase. We demonstrate the practicability of both approaches in an experimental comparison regarding runtime and prediction accuracy. Although currently available annotated real-world data is still limited, we obtain a high accuracy using CNNs, in particular, when the training set is enriched by augmented examples.},

This paper encompasses a wholesome approach to mine entity-relation and building knowledge graph from textual documents. The paper concentrates on two approaches to classify directional entity relations. We build on extending pretrained language model i.e. BERT for text classification along-side providing entity and directionality information as input making it entity-aware BERT classifier. We also did ablation studies of presented model in terms of various ways of providing entity information on the learning capabilities of model. We demonstrate the end to end pipeline for building an entity-relation extraction system in a business application. The techniques proposed in the paper are also evaluated against SemEval-2010 Task 8, a popular relation classification dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that learning entity-aware relations through language models outperforms almost all the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

Although ABM software is much easier to use than it was even 20 years ago and sufficiently powerful computers are more readily available, the success of a modelling project is still largely determined by decisions made about the purpose and design of the model, and the subsequent experimental regime. This chapter guides the reader through those key issues. It covers epistemological topics such as the role of the model in a wider project, the trade-off between realism and generality, the idea of generative modelling and the importance of adequate experimentation. It also discusses technical issues such as options for the integration of ABM and GIS, and even the dangers inherent in poor design decisions about the scheduling of agent behaviour.},

  abstract = {The Sumerians organized their gods, which were deified natural forces as conceived, into a systematic pantheon for a land of city states. This continued with modifications under the succeeding Babylonian civilization, which was politically unified. The process of identifying originally distinct gods of similar attributes continued until some scholars identified all major gods with Marduk in a kind of monotheism. Relics of other systems occur in the worship of mountains and rivers, and in southern Iraq itself the concept of deity spread from the god himself to his accoutrements, abode and city. Les Sum{\'e}riens organisaient leurs dieux, con{\c c}us comme des forces naturelles d{\'e}ifi{\'e}es, en un panth{\'e}on syst{\'e}matique qui convenait {\`a} un pays compos{\'e} de cit{\'e}s souveraines. Cette situation se maintint avec quelques modifications dans l'Empire babylonien, qui {\'e}tait unifi{\'e} politiquement. Le processus d'identification des dieux, distincts {\`a} l'origine mais avec des attributs similaires, se poursuivit jusqu'{\`a} ce que certains {\'e}rudits eussent assimil{\'e} tous les dieux importants {\`a} Marduk dans une sorte de monoth{\'e}isme. On trouve dans les textes des allusions {\`a} d'autres syst{\`e}mes pour ce qui est de l'adoration des montagnes et des rivi{\`e}res, et dans le sud de l'Irak, la notion de divinit{\'e} s'est {\'e}tendue du dieu lui-m{\^e}me {\`a} son {\'e}quipement, son temple et sa ville.},

Specifically, the article argues that Idrimi is presented as a Mittani hero, but the story of his life is told in a Northwest Semitic-Akkadian code; an imperial vision receives a local expression. From this conclusion, the article ends by trying to infer something about the inscription's intended audience.}

  abstract = {We present models which complete missing text given transliterations of ancient Mesopotamian documents, originally written on cuneiform clay tablets (2500 BCE - 100 CE). Due to the tablets' deterioration, scholars often rely on contextual cues to manually fill in missing parts in the text in a subjective and time-consuming process. We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89\% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods. Finally, we conduct human evaluations showing the applicability of our models in assisting experts to transcribe texts in extinct languages.},

  abstract = {At least some ancient civilizations used various risk-management strategies to minimize price volatility. In this article, we examine one such strategy, grain storage, by means of a dataset recently made available that provides agricultural prices for Babylonia during the Late Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods (c.400--65 BCE). A comparative analysis of medieval England and Hellenistic Babylonia reveals a low level of inter-annual storage in both economies, and helps us to compare the costs and benefits in each society. Costs are largely equated with interest rates, and benefits with seasonal price changes. Unlike in England, Babylonia's dual crop structure (barley and dates) reduced seasonality and thus the potential benefits of storage. There is no evidence, however, that storage costs -- that is, interest rates -- were likewise lower. This suggests that interest rates were primarily determined in the urban and commercial sectors, not the agricultural one. Consequently, measures of seasonal price changes in pre-modern economies may tell us relatively little about interest rates. While the McCloskey--Nash methodology may be helpful in analysing particular economies, it is perhaps of limited use for comparing them.},

  abstract = {Ontology classification is the reasoning service that computes all subsumption relationships inferred in an ontology between concept, role, and attribute names in the ontology signature. OWL 2 QL is a tractable profile of OWL 2 for which ontology classification is polynomial in the size of the ontology TBox. However, to date, no efficient methods and implementations specifically tailored to OWL 2 QL ontologies have been developed. In this paper, we provide a new algorithm for ontology classification in OWL 2 QL, which is based on the idea of encoding the ontology TBox into a directed graph and reducing core reasoning to computation of the transitive closure of the graph. We have implemented the algorithm in the QuOnto reasoner and extensively evaluated it over very large ontologies. Our experiments show that QuOnto outperforms various popular reasoners in classification of OWL 2 QL ontologies.},

These texts, dealing with impending dangers (mainly snakebites) and witchcraft attacks, are placed in the context of Ancient Near Eastern magic literature. A discussion of general topics, including magic and religion, the Ugaritic gods of magic, and the definition of incantation, is followed by a new collation and translation of the Akkadian texts, as well as new photographic material for both series. The main focus of this book is the close reading of the consonantal texts in the context of the much larger and better analyzed corpus of Akkadian magic literature.},

The term 'formative phase' of the Neo-Babylonian Empire refers to the ca. 40 years between Nabopolassar's accession to the Babylonian throne in 626 BCE and the mid-reign of his son and successor, Nebuchadnezzar, ca. 585 BCE. In many ways, these letters are the closest we get to the erratic drama which was day-to-day life in Babylonia at the mid first millennium BCE. The letters were a vital administrative tool, necessary for the ongoing functioning of these institutions. As such, they provide first-hand testimony for the tasks and obstacles that the Neo-Babylonian bureaucrats faced. The Neo-Babylonian letters are still one of the most underrepresented and underexploited source material in Neo-Babylonian studies. This is due to the lack of up-to-date editions, the 'elusive nature' of epistolography (namely the difficulty in accurately dating and contextualising the letters), as well as the unique philological difficulties of the texts. These factors are in fact feeding each other. No systematic attempt has been made to date and contextualise the Neo-Babylonian administrative letters and they have never been studied as a group},

While new texts, which hitherto have not been considered in this context, can be brought to bear on the issue, direct evidence from these provinces is still scarce. These documents will thus be supplemented by drawing on the rich information concerning state institutions and resource extraction in the imperial centre. It is argued that in the first half of the Neo-Babylonian period, until ca. 585 BCE, Babylonian imperial rule in the western periphery can be conceptualized primarily as a straightforward exploitative tributary regime. From about the mid-reign of Nebuchadnezzar onwards, however, there is a shift towards a more sustainable resource extraction through the creation of stable pockets of Babylonian presence in the periphery. This diachronic shift was meant to steady and organize the initial ad hoc Babylonian approach. These measures, however, did not prevail, and the chaotic years which followed the 43 years reign of Nebuchadnezzar illustrate the fragility of the relatively short-lived Babylonian imperial age.},

This study examines these factors, namely how object interactivity, user-generated contents (UGC) and avatar proximity influence engagement. We designed a Hybrid Virtual and Augmented Reality (HVAR) environment that supports paired users to experience cultural heritage in both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). A user study was conducted with 60 participants, providing assessments of engagement and presence via questionnaires, together with mobile electroencephalogram (mEEG) and user activity data that measures VR user engagement in real-time. Our findings provide insights into how engagement between users can occur in HVAR environments for the future hybrid reality with multi-device connectivity.},

This complexity requires that the data model enables to describe different outcomes of the creative process, from the writing of the score, to its performance and publishing. In this paper, we show how we design the DOREMUS ontology as an extension of the FRBRoo model in order to represent music metadata coming from different libraries and cultural institutions and how we publish this data as RDF graphs. We designed and re-used several controlled vocabularies that provide common identifiers that overcome the differences in language and alternative forms of needed concepts. These graphs are interlinked to each other and to external resources on the Web of Data. We show how these graphs can be walked through for designing a web-based application providing an exploratory search engine for presenting complex music metadata to the end-user.

Efficient computational methods for condensing and simplifying data are thus becoming vital for extracting actionable insights. In particular, while data summarization techniques have been studied extensively, only recently has summarizing interconnected data, or               graphs               , become popular. This survey is a structured, comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods for summarizing graph data. We first broach the motivation behind and the challenges of graph summarization. We then categorize summarization approaches by the type of graphs taken as input and further organize each category by core methodology. Finally, we discuss applications of summarization on real-world graphs and conclude by describing some open problems in the field.},

The book covers core areas of sentiment analysis and also includes related topics such as debate analysis, intention mining, and fake-opinion detection. It will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in natural language processing, computer science, management sciences, and the social sciences.In addition to traditional computational methods, this second edition includes recent deep learning methods to analyze and summarize sentiments and opinions, and also new material on emotion and mood analysis techniques, emotion-enhanced dialogues, and multimodal emotion analysis.},

Since the beginning of the Holocene, human activity is present at different scales from the catchment to the channel and has had an increasing influence on fluvial systems. Today, many river--floodplain systems are transformed in course of river restorations to ``natural'' hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions without human impacts. Information is missing for the historical or rather ``natural'' as well as for the present-day situation. Changes of the ``natural'' sediment fluxes in the last centuries result in changes of the fluvial morphology. The success of river restorations depends on substantial knowledge about historical as well as present-day fluvial morphodynamics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the consequences of historical impacts on fluvial morphodynamics and additionally the future implications of present-day human impacts in course of river restorations. The objective of this review is to summarize catchment impacts and river channel impacts since the beginning of the Holocene in Europe on the fluvial morphodynamics, to critically investigate their consequences on the environment, and to evaluate the possibility to return to a ``natural'' morphological river state.},

New data from a range of field studies demonstrate that Croll--Milankovitch forcing, Dansgaard--Oeschger and Heinrich events, enhanced monsoon circulation, millennial- to centennial-scale climate variability within the Holocene (probably associated with solar forcing and deep ocean circulation) and flood-event variability in recent centuries can all be discerned in the fluvial record. Although very significant advances have been made in river system and climate change research in recent years, the potential of fluvial palaeohydrology has yet to be fully realized, to the detriment of climatology, public health, resource management and river engineering.},

Gardens were both a setting and showcase for nearly every aspect of social and daily life at the royal court during the early Islamic period in Western Asia. Safa Mahmoudian uses a wide range of primary source materials including contemporary Arabic manuscripts, together with archaeological reports, aerial photographs, and archaeologists' letters and diaries. Through close readings of this evidence, Mahmoudian creates a picture of these gardens in their historical, architectural and environmental contexts and examines various factors that influenced their design and placement. In doing so, Mahmoudian adds to our understanding of these gardens and palaces and, ultimately, early Islamic-period court culture as a whole.},

The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.},

  abstract = {After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate - database. Many new media objects do not tell stories; they don't have a beginning or end; in fact, they don't have any development, thematically, formally or otherwise which would organise their elements into a sequence. Instead, they are collections of individual items, where every item has the same significance as any other. Why do new media favour database form over others? Can we explain its popularity by analysing the specificity of the digital medium and computer programming? What is the relationship between database and another form, which has traditionally dominated human culture - narrative? In addressing these questions, the article discusses the connection between the computer's ontology - the way the computer's organisation of data represents the world - and the new cultural forms privileged by computer culture such as database. Saussure's notions of the paradigm and the syntagm are used to theorise the relationship between database and narrative. A possible history of a database form in modern media and culture in general is sketched. The last part of the article addreses the tension between database and narrative in the history of cinema. It considers the works of such filmmakers as Peter Greenaway and Dziga Vertov as part of the tradition which can be called 'database cinema'. This cinema tries to merge databases and narrative into a new form, thus anticipating one of the key problems of new media art.},

In this paper, we tackle these issues by analyzing, within the new FloodPlains Web GIS project, a conspicuous amount of archaeological evidence collected over the past decades at approximately 5000 sites in southern Mesopotamia. We have measured modifications over time in a variety of demographic proxies generated through probabilistic approaches: our results show that the rapid climate changes, especially those that occurred around 5.2, 4.2, and 3.2 ka BP, may have contributed---in addition to other socioeconomic factors---to triggering the main urban and demographic cycles in southern Mesopotamia and that each cycle is characterized by specific settlement strategies in terms of the distribution and the dimension of the urban centers.},

This proliferation of cultural heritage knowledge in textual discourse form requires support for information structuration and extraction of the semantic relations embedded in these texts, in order to fully understand and post-process them. Previous works show that discourse analysis techniques can represent pieces of textual information in a highly structured manner, identifying the semantic relations between them and the entities referred to in the discourse according to well-established linguistic patterns. This is particularly useful for aligning the structure and information extracted with information system post-processing techniques, such as natural language processing, that are currently applied to cultural heritage. In this paper, we apply discourse models through a previously developed methodology to a real case study to represent and analyse cultural heritage textual narratives. Then, we perform an empirical study with cultural heritage experts in order to validate the models obtained, the resultant information, some usability aspects of the approach, and the degree of agreement between experts. The main objective was to obtain empirical and quantitative validation of the application of our proposed discourse analysis methodology to narratives in cultural heritage, its implications for different specialists, and its possibilities as a methodology to assist in providing structure to and capturing the semantics of freestyle documents, to automatize some discourse information extraction tasks and to facilitate their post-processing.},

A nested and integrative approach is developed that draws on a wide range of spatially extensive datasets to outline meaningful trends in settlement, water management and regional defensive systems during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The significance of the regional centre of T{\"u}rkmen-Karah{\"o}y{\"u}k for a reconstruction of early state polities between the 13th and eighth centuries BCE is addressed. In light of this regional analysis, it is tentatively suggested that, during the Late Bronze Age, T{\"u}rkmen-Karah{\"o}y{\"u}k was the location of the city of Tarḫunta{\v s}{\v s}a, briefly the Hittite capital during the reign of Muwatalli II. More assuredly, based on the analysis of the newly discovered Middle Iron Age T{\"U}RKMEN-KARAH{\"O}Y{\"U}K 1 inscription, it is proposed that T{\"u}rkmen-Karah{\"o}y{\"u}k was the seat of a kingdom during the eighth century BCE that likely encompassed the Konya and Karaman plains.            ,               {\"O}zet              Bu makale Konya B{\"o}lgesi Arkeolojik Y{\"u}zey Ara{\c s}tirmasi Projesi'nin (2016--2020) verilerini ve sonu{\c c}larini Orta Anadolu'da Konya ve Karaman ovalarindaki en erken {\c s}ehirlere ve eyaletlere dair kanitlarin saptanmasi amaciyla sentezlemektedir.

  abstract = {In Picturing Space, Displacing Bodies, Lyle Massey argues that we can only learn how and why certain kinds of spatial representation prevailed over others by carefully considering how Renaissance artists and theorists interpreted perspective. Combining detailed historical studies with broad theoretical and philosophical investigations, this book challenges basic assumptions about the way early modern artists and theorists represented their relationship to the visible world and how they understood these representations. By analyzing technical feats such as anamorphosis (the perspectival distortion of an object to make it viewable only from a certain angle), drawing machines, and printed diagrams, each chapter highlights the moments when perspective theorists failed to unite a singular, ideal viewpoint with the artist\&amp;'s or viewer\&amp;'s viewpoint or were unsuccessful at conjoining fictive and lived space.Showing how these \&amp;``failures\&amp;'' were subsequently incorporated rather than rejected by perspective theorists, the book presents an important reassessment of the standard view of Renaissance perspective. While many scholars have maintained that perspective rationalized the relationships among optics, space, and painting, Picturing Space, Displacing Bodies asserts instead that Renaissance and early modern theorists often revealed a disjunction between geometrical ideals and practical applications. In some cases, they not only identified but also exploited these discrepancies. This discussion of perspective shows that the painter\&amp;'s geometry did not always conform to the explicitly rational, Cartesian formula that so many have assumed, nor did it historically unfold according to a standard account of scientific development.},

While the reverse appears to be an ad hoc list of personal names, many of which start with or contain the sign a, the obverse compiles ``places'' (ki) where certain mythological events involving the goddess Inanna had occurred. Unusually for lexical lists, each of these places is described in a complete sentence following a loosely alternating structure, which gives the list almost literary qualities. After discussing the list-like vs. literary features and comparing the compilation of places to a similar lexical fragment of Ur III date and the Early Dynastic Word List F, we analyze the mythological allusions and potential ritual associations.},

In 1901, a rich collection of extracts from documents relating to witch beliefs and witch trials in the Middle Ages - Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung in Mittelalter - was published. Most of the original documents are in Latin, with some in medieval German and French, and it has been left largely untranslated, making the material inaccessible, and neglected. This new translation of the key documents will enable students and scholars to look afresh at this crucial period in the development of attitudes towards witchcraft. Through the translated extracts we can see the beliefs and activities which had been formally condemned by ecclesiastical and secular authorities, but which had not yet become subject to widespread eradicating pogroms, start to be allied with heresy and with changing conceptions of demonic activity. The extensive introductory essay gives the reader the historical, theological, intellectual and social background and contexts of the translated documents. The translations themselves will all have introductory notes. This volume will contribute significantly to our understanding of the witchcraft phenomenon in the Middle Ages},

  abstract = {This paper shows an interplay of music and mathematics which strongly differs from the usual scheme reducing mathematics to a toolbox of formal models for music. Using the topos of directed graphs as a common base category, we develop a comprising framework for mathematical music theory, which ramifies into an algebraic and a topological branch. Whereas the algebraic component comprises the universe of formulae, transformations, and functional constraints as they are described by functorial diagrammatic limits, the topological branch covers the continuous aspects of the creative dynamics of musical gestures and their multilayered articulation. These two branches unfold in a surprisingly parallel manner, although the concrete structures (homotopy versus representation theory) are fairly heterogeneous. However, the unity of the underlying musical substance suggests that these two apparently divergent strategies should find a common point of unification, an idea that we describe in terms of a conjectural diamond of categories which suggests a number of unification points. In particular, the passage from the topological to the algebraic branch is achieved by the idea of the gestoid, an `algebraic' category associated with the fundamental groupoid of a gesture.},

  abstract = {One of the most significant transformations in the emergence of economically and socially complex societies has been the development of social groups with differential access to productive resources. Anthropologists have puzzled over the number of empirical cases suggesting that women have disproportionately lost access to productive resources. This paper follows one such case---the development of textile workshops in Mesopotamia---to offer new insights into the alienation of women producers in the ancient Near East and the development of Mesopotamia's political economies. During the transformation from a series of relatively self-sufficient communities to a highly integrated complex of rural and urban settlements, a fundamental shift took place from the use of flax to the use of wool for the majority of textile production. This shift has extremely important implications for archaeologists' reconstructions of agricultural production, labor roles, and social relationships. This paper explores the socioeconomic context of a change in the materials of textile production and its potential for explaining the development of important aspects of social complexity and political economy in ancient Mesopotamia.}

From satellite imagery to 3D modeling, today archaeologists are answering questions about human history that could previously only be imagined. As archaeologists create a better and more complete picture of the past, they sometimes find that truth is stranger than fiction.},

  abstract = {This poster presents findings from a recent survey of Ancient World researchers, which sought to identify research methods associated with the use and production of digital resources in general and with Linked Data in particular. It illustrates the results of the survey using graphs and charts, accompanied by a brief explanation of the methodology and my initial interpretation of these findings. Results are suggestive of a possible conflict between producer aims and user needs.  The survey formed part of a current PhD project to explore where Linked Data might best be integrated with existing research methods. To ensure consistent classification of research methods identified during the survey, I incorporated the Taxonomy for Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) - an ontology describing research methods, techniques and information resources. The survey took place in spring 2018 and received 212 responses from Ancient World researchers in 32 countries, with a broad spread of age ranges and good gender balance.  Findings indicate that while there are similarities between the methods that participants associated with their use of digital resources in general and Linked Data in particular, there is a possible disconnect with research methods associated with the production of Linked Data resources. Specifically, users tend to be most interested in search and discovery functionality, while producers appear to focus primarily on contextualisation. Future work will include interviews with a sample of participants to explore survey responses in more detail, with the eventual aim of producing a series of recommendations for how Linked Data resources can be made more useful and usable.},

  abstract = {The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge in the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform signs have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare signs. Our code, data, and trained models are available at the project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/ProtoSnap/},

Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications. The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS also provides a lightweight, intuitive language for developing and sharing new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web Ontology language (OWL). This document is the normative specification of the Simple Knowledge Organization System. It is intended for readers who are involved in the design and implementation of information systems, and who already have a good understanding of Semantic Web technology, especially RDF and OWL. For an informative guide to using SKOS, see the [SKOS-PRIMER].},

  abstract = {Between the ninth and seventh centuries BCE, the Neo-Assyrian Empire became the largest the world had yet seen. In the process of imperial conquest, the Assyrian state incorporated previously foreign territories and people into their world. Landscapes, materials, and the labor of conquered bodies became a part of the Assyrian royal palaces of northern Iraq, both as elements of their construction and as themes emphasized within the extensive visual programs of the palace reliefs. Within and through visual depiction of enemy bodies and foreign landscapes, in the process of being (often violently) reshaped by Assyrian hands, Neo-Assyrian kings brought the farthest reaches of their world into the center of imperial power. This article considers how specific strategies of representation in palace art allowed the Assyrian palace to serve as a microcosm of the empire and a map of its borders. Palace art emphasized the remade, reworked, or recreated, defining ``Assyrianness'' as that which remakes and has been remade. As a central act of remaking, I examine representations of captive or submissive foreigners, whose presence in the reliefs commemorates their humiliation while compounding and enhancing it in the very ways that these figures are depicted: cringing, deficient, and physiologically incorrect. I pay particular attention to examples from the late King Ashurbanipal's reign, in which foreign leaders are singled out through representation with distinctive facial features. I argue that this act of (literally) drawing distinctions was an inherently imperial process, one that both expressed and enabled an ideology of expansion and control.}

Most of the signs listed have been collated. The sign list is classified according to Old Babylonian main forms. Each entry consists of a main form and up to 16 variants supposed to cover the spectrum of a sign as far as possible. All forms are listed with their quotations differentiated according to the origin of the tablet. In addition to the sign forms the list also provided the corresponding values and Diri. Some of the values are explained in detail in a commentary at the end of the sign list. The book concludes with four indices referencing the main forms, the ambiguous forms, the values and the sign names (with their concordances to other sign lists).},

It is often noted that stories of witchcraft circulated in Greek and Latin classical texts, and that treatises dealing with witch-beliefs referenced them. Still, the role of humanistic culture and classical revival in the developing of the witch-hunts has not yet been fully researched. Marina Montesano examines Greek and Latin literature, revealing how particular features of ancient striges were carried into the Late Middle Ages, through the Renaissance and into the fifteenth century, when early Italian trials recall the myth of the strix common in ancient Latin sources and in popular memory. The final chapter also serves as a conclusion, to show how in Renaissance Italy and beyond, classical accounts of witchcraft ceased to be just stories, as they had formerly been, and were instead used to attest to the reality of witches' powers},

Wherever two or more people are functioning as a social group that group not only consists of those individuals, but, more important perhaps, if that is possible, than the individuals themselves and without which their functioning as a social group cauld not be expressed, are the relations which maintain between them. It is these intangible, imponderable and invisible aspects of the situation which enable the mathematical sum of a certain number of individuals to function as a social group. Dr. Moreno's book might he described briefly as a study of these relations between individuals. Dr. Moreno develops a technique for a process of classification which is calculated, among other things, to bring individuals together who are capable of harmonious inter-personal relationships, and so creating a social group which can function at the maximum efficiency and with the minimum of disruptive tendencies and processes.

  abstract = {Time modeling is a crucial feature in many application domains. However, temporal information often is not crisp, but is uncertain, subjective and vague. This is particularly true when representing historical information, as historical accounts are inherently imprecise. Similarly, we conjecture that in the Semantic Web representing uncertain temporal information will be a common requirement. Hence, existing approaches for temporal modeling based on crisp representation of time cannot be applied to these advanced modeling tasks. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we present fuzzy interval-based temporal model capable of representing imprecise temporal knowledge. Our approach naturally subsumes existing crisp temporal models, i.e. crisp temporal relationships are intuitively represented in our system. Apart from presenting the fuzzy temporal model, we discuss how this model is integrated with the ontology model to allow annotating ontology definitions with time specifications.},

The validity of ``attention as explanation'' has so far been evaluated by computing the rank correlation between attention-based explanations and existing feature attribution explanations using LSTM-based models. In our work, we (i) compare the rank correlation between five more recent feature attribution methods and two attention-based methods, on two types of NLP tasks, and (ii) extend this analysis to also include transformer-based models. We find that attention-based explanations do not correlate strongly with any recent feature attribution methods, regardless of the model or task. Furthermore, we find that none of the tested explanations correlate strongly with one another for the transformer-based model, leading us to question the underlying assumption that we should measure the validity of attention-based explanations based on how well they correlate with existing feature attribution explanation methods. After conducting experiments on five datasets using two different models, we argue that the community should stop using rank correlation as an evaluation metric for attention-based explanations. We suggest that researchers and practitioners should instead test various explanation methods and employ a human-in-theloop process to determine if the explanations align with human intuition for the particular use case at hand.},

However, the SFP is more complex to envision when `composite forms' such as novels and dialogues are involved. In this article, and following the work of Bakhtin and Gasset, we present the idea that a composite semiotic form, such as a paragraph in a novel, does not stand for a simple referential situation only, but provides us with a context for anticipation. We show how these ideas can be expressed in the state-of-the-art language models in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the way AI may provide us with novel directions for developing old practices of interpretation.},

Further, annotation tools are also used to extract new information for a particular use case. However, owing to the high number of existing annotation tools, finding the one that best fits particular needs is a demanding task that requires searching the scientific literature followed by installing and trying various tools.We searched for annotation tools and selected a subset of them according to five requirements with which they should comply, such as being Web-based or supporting the definition of a schema. We installed the selected tools (when necessary), carried out hands-on experiments and evaluated them using 26 criteria that covered functional and technical aspects. We defined each criterion on three levels of matches and a score for the final evaluation of the tools.We evaluated 78 tools and selected the following 15 for a detailed evaluation: BioQRator, brat, Catma, Djangology, ezTag, FLAT, LightTag, MAT, MyMiner, PDFAnno, prodigy, tagtog, TextAE, WAT-SL and WebAnno. Full compliance with our 26 criteria ranged from only 9 up to 20 criteria, which demonstrated that some tools are comprehensive and mature enough to be used on most annotation projects. The highest score of 0.81 was obtained by WebAnno (of a maximum value of 1.0).},

  abstract = {Statements about RDF statements, or meta triples, provide additional information about individual triples, such as the source, the occurring time or place, or the certainty. Integrating such meta triples into semantic knowledge bases would enable the querying and reasoning mechanisms to be aware of provenance, time, location, or certainty of triples. However, an efficient RDF representation for such meta knowledge of triples remains challenging. The existing standard reification approach allows such meta knowledge of RDF triples to be expressed using RDF by two steps. The first step is representing the triple by a Statement instance which has subject, predicate, and object indicated separately in three different triples. The second step is creating assertions about that instance as if it is a statement. While reification is simple and intuitive, this approach does not have formal semantics and is not commonly used in practice as described in the RDF Primer., In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Singleton Property for representing statements about statements and provide a formal semantics for it. We explain how this singleton property approach fits well with the existing syntax and formal semantics of RDF, and the syntax of SPARQL query language. We also demonstrate the use of singleton property in the representation and querying of meta knowledge in two examples of Semantic Web knowledge bases: YAGO2 and BKR. Our experiments on the BKR show that the singleton property approach gives a decent performance in terms of number of triples, query length and query execution time compared to existing approaches. This approach, which is also simple and intuitive, can be easily adopted for representing and querying statements about statements in other knowledge bases.},

  abstract = {The Singleton Property (SP) approach has been proposed for representing and querying metadata about RDF triples such as provenance, time, location, and evidence. In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.},

  abstract = {From the ninth century until the last quarter of the seventh century BCE, the Assyrian Empire first extended its power over Babylonia and then engaged in a prolonged effort to retain control. The patchwork nature of Babylonian society---divided as it was between the traditional urban centers, territories controlled by five distinct Chaldean tribes, and regions inhabited by Aramaean tribes---presented opportunities and challenges for Assyria as it sought to assert its dominance. Assyrian interactions with the Chaldean tribes of Babylonia redefined the Chaldeans' place within power relationships in southern Mesopotamia. Starting in 878, Assyria first perceived Chaldean territory as distinct from what they defined as Kardunia{\v s}, the land ruled by the king of Babylon. Shalmaneser III exploited and accentuated this division by recognizing the Chaldean leaders as kings and accepting their tribute even as he concluded a treaty with the Babylonian king, Marduk-zakir-shumi I. By decentralizing power in Babylonia, Assyria was able to assert indirect control over Babylonia. However, periods of Assyrian weakness created opportunities for several Chaldeans---drawing upon the economic and military power they could muster---to claim the title of king of Babylon with all the accompanying ideological power. These new developments prompted Assyria under the Sargonids to create counter-narratives that questioned the legitimacy of Chaldeans as kings of Babylon by presenting them as strange and inimical to the Assyrian order even as Assyrian interactions with the Chaldeans improved Assyrian familiarity with them.}

The Egyptian sources are taken as a point of departure for reconstructing the course of the campaign and its objectives. The texts of 1 Kings 14:25---28 and 2 Chronicles 12:2---12 are examined separately, each in its own right. Shishak's campaign is the earliest episode that is related in both biblical and extra-biblical sources, and it is evident that the author of Kings had a source, possibly an old chronicle, from which he learned of the Egyptian campaign and tried to describe it in his history. The author of Chronicles, on the other hand, had no source other than the Book of Kings, and his 'logical' reworking and expansion of this source, coupled with his distinctive doctrine of retribution, led him far astray from historical reality. Discussion of the archaeological aspects of the campaign indicates that it had no long-range effect on sites located in the northern parts of Palestine, but was disastrous for the settlement in the Negev Highlands. The Kingdom of Israel gradually recovered and developed in the ninth century into a full blown state; the inhabitants of the Negev Highlands were unable to recover and reverted to their former mode of existence, pastoral nomadism, deserting their settlements and they became once again an 'invisible' element in the desert area.},

They were sometimes viewed as efficient institutions that guaranteed quality and skills. But they also excluded competitors, manipulated markets, and blocked innovations. Did the benefits of guilds outweigh their costs? Analyzing thousands of guilds that dominated European economies from 1000 to 1880, The European Guilds uses vivid examples and clear economic reasoning to answer that question. Sheilagh Ogilvie's book features the voices of honorable guild masters, underpaid journeymen, exploited apprentices, shady officials, and outraged customers, and follows the stories of the ``vile encroachers''---women, migrants, Jews, gypsies, bastards, and many others---desperate to work but hunted down by the guilds as illicit competitors. She investigates the benefits of guilds but also shines a light on their dark side. Guilds sometimes provided important services, but they also manipulated markets to profit their members. They regulated quality but prevented poor consumers from buying goods cheaply. They fostered work skills but denied apprenticeships to outsiders. They transmitted useful techniques but blocked innovations that posed a threat. Guilds existed widely not because they corrected market failures or served the common good but because they benefited two powerful groups---guild members and political elites. Exploring guilds' inner workings across eight centuries, The European Guilds shows how privileged institutions and exclusive networks shape the wider economy---for good or ill.},

Distributional conflicts provide a better explanation than efficiency for the core economic institutions of pre-industrial Europe: serfdom, the community, the craft guild, and the merchant guild. The article concludes by proposing four desiderata for any economic theory of institutions.},

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies.},

  abstract = {ResearchSpace is an open source platform designed at the British Museum to help establish a community of researchers, where their underlying activities are framed by data sharing, active engagement in formal arguments, and semantic publishing. Using Semantic Web languages and technologies, the innovations of the system are shaped by a social conceptualisation of the graph-based representation of information. This is employed by integrated semantic components aimed at subject experts that offer mechanisms to create, annotate, assert, argue, search, cite, and justify data-driven research. This paper showcases a new onto-epistemological approach that supports researchers to contribute to a growing and sustainable corpus of knowledge that has history, not just provenance, built-in. It describes our considerations in designing for interdisciplinary collaboration, usability and trust in the digital space, highlighted by use cases in archaeology, art history, and history of science.},

However, a vast network of content based on publishing pages creates problems for effective search, discovery, and reuse. The Linked Open Data movement seeks to remedy these limitations by supporting a new Web of Data. While the popularity and availability of Linked Open Data increase, it does not necessarily support understanding or provide the context and meaning to make it useful for humanist researchers. It also does not necessarily include the scientific requirements of transparency and reproducibility. The complex and heterogeneous nature of humanities datasets, together with the different contexts or perspectives that they contain, require the addition of meaning (semantics) to make them useful, yet the Semantic Web has become the poor relation in term of adoption, despite promising the elements to support high-quality digital humanities projects, and create a Web of data that better represents human knowledge.},

Aun as{\'i}, mucho de lo que se ha publicado hasta el momento se ha centrado en el siglo XIX, en cuestiones de yacimientos concretos o en personajes destacados. La investigaci{\'o}n sobre los primeros exploradores, el desarrollo general de intereses acad{\'e}micos en la regi{\'o}n y el potencial uso pr{\'a}ctico de los escritos de viajes todav{\'i}a tienen que integrarse plenamente en la disciplina arqueol{\'o}gica del Pr{\'o}ximo Oriente antiguo. Con la moda actual de los estudios sobre viajes y las recientes publicaciones de algunas visiones generales que ofrecen nuevos elementos significativos parece que ha llegado el momento de ver c{\'o}mo se ha desarrollado la relaci{\'o}n existente entre la literatura de viajes y la arqueolog{\'i}a del Pr{\'o}ximo Oriente -en concreto de (la baja) Mesopotamia-. Este art{\'i}culo defiende que el desarrollo de la arqueolog{\'i}a mesopot{\'a}mica como una disciplina aparte y una percepci{\'o}n concreta de su historia han introducido durante los siglos XIX y XX una cu{\~n}a entre el arque{\'o}logo y el viajero, as{\'i} como entre la investigaci{\'o}n arqueol{\'o}gica y la literatura de viajes. Como visi{\'o}n general del cambio en las relaciones entre ambos, este art{\'i}culo aboga por una mayor integraci{\'o}n de los estudios sobre viajes en el campo de la arqueolog{\'i}a.Palabras clave: Arqueolog{\'i}a, viaje, Mesopotamia, literatura, historia disciplinaria.~AbstractStudying the links between travel, travel literature and the archaeology of the Near East has, over the course of the past decade, slowly developed from a side-step of archaeology into a more `proper' field of enquiry. However, much of what has been published so far has remained focused on the nineteenth century, on site-specific issues or on highlighted individuals. Research into the early explorers, the broad developments of academic interests in the region and the potential practical use of travel writing have yet to become fully integrated into the Near Eastern archaeological discipline. With the present vogue of travel studies and the recent publication of several overviews offering significant new insights, the time seems at hand for an examination of how the relationships between travel literature and Near Eastern --specifically (lower) Mesopotamian-- archaeology have developed over time. This paper argues that the development of Mesopotamian archaeology as a distinct discipline and a specific perception of its history have during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries drawn a wedge between the archaeologist and the traveler, as well as between archaeological research and travel literature. As a general overview of changing relationships between the two, the paper pleads for a more thorough integration of travel studies into the field of archaeology.Keywords: Archaeology, travel, Mesopotamia, literature, disciplinary history.},

  abstract = {The content in information systems and virtual reconstructions in the cultural heritage sector is to a large degree directly based on information deduced from the study of texts. In many cases, even if the texts are available electronically, the links from the deduced facts to the original texts are not available and in many cases very costly to re-establish. Reproducibility of results is a core concept in text-based research as in all research. Thus, such links should be expressed explicitly in the systems and in accordance with the data standards developed in the fields of text encoding and conceptual modelling. To do this it is necessary to create a combined understanding of text encoding represented by the TEI guidelines and the understanding of conceptual models represented by initiatives like the CIDOC CRM and FRBR oo . In this article, we study a part of this complex by comparing the expressive power of the real world descriptions TEI P5 by mapping central parts of the CIDOC CRM onto TEI P5. It is clear that the TEI P5 has moved a great step in the direction towards an event-oriented model compared with TEI P4. Our use of CIDOC CRM as a yardstick shows that the expressive-ness of TEI P5 can be greatly improved by extending the scope of very restricted elements like the relation element and adding a few new elements to the TEI.},

As a result, a still divisive movement of digital humanities (DH) has emerged over the last few decades. This article attempts to provide a theoretical contribution to the discussion of the core fundamentals of the field. In order to do so, it takes a sample of papers indexed under Library and Information Science, in the Web of Knowledge database, and studies them using a quantitative data analysis and a qualitative literature review combined with the author's personal reflection to illustrate the main research topics. The notion of scholarly primitives, initially formulated by John Unsworth, provides the background for the theoretical analysis. It is concluded that DH embody a community patterned by collaborative and shared networks of communication, where digital tools amplify research possibilities without changing the humanistic values of its practitioners.},

As classical geography was not only a graphic representation of the world, but a multi-layered cultural system based on specific notions and concepts, it is now necessary to go beyond the taxonomy of place-names and their visualization on modern maps. The interpretation of ancient geography as a `mental model' implies the importance of different and complementary aspects which should be addressed systematically: the expression of distances, the language of spatial orientation, the definition of environmental landmarks. For each of these aspects an integrated digital methodology is proposed, either implementing existing infrastructures or focusing on new strategies. The conclusion establishes a workflow to be tested on the corpus of the Geographi Graeci Minores, and extended to a variety of other texts.},

Since there are many ways to define writing style, the result not only depends on the clustering method but even more so on the measure of similarity. With authorship attribution, the predominant application of stylometry, as its benchmark much research has addressed the utility of methods for measuring similarity. We use a corpus of German-language novellas to demonstrate that one may be interested in very different meaningful groups of texts simultaneously, and that these can be recovered from stylometric clustering if the measure is chosen accordingly. As can be expected, different measures do better at recovering groups associated with, for instance, subgenre, author gender, or narrative perspective. As a consequence, it is suggested that corpus analyses should not be based on what is currently considered the most refined measure of stylometric similarity, but rather break down the decisions that yield a specific measure and provide substantively justified arguments for them.},

Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause  at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained  reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editions---and the theories that underpin them. The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected.  Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind. Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation of the discipline---one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and printed works from across literary history, and the globe.  The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing, along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting point for further scholarship. This collection is essential reading for editors, scholars, students and readers who are invested in the future of textual scholarship and the digital humanities.},

The plethora of copies created around the Islamic world over the course of eight centuries testifies to the enduring importance of these medieval visions for the Muslim cartographic imagination. With Medieval Islamic Maps, historian Karen C. Pinto brings us the first in-depth exploration of medieval Islamic cartography from the mid-tenth to the nineteenth century.  Pinto focuses on the distinct tradition of maps known collectively as the Book of Roads and Kingdoms (Kitab al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik, or KMMS), examining them from three distinct angles---iconography, context, and patronage. She untangles the history of the KMMS maps, traces their inception and evolution, and analyzes them to reveal the identities of their creators, painters, and patrons, as well as the vivid realities of the social and physical world they depicted. In doing so, Pinto develops innovative techniques for approaching the visual record of Islamic history, explores how medieval Muslims perceived themselves and their world, and brings Middle Eastern maps into the forefront of the study of the history of cartography.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the humanities, text comparison is essential for scholarly editing the traditions of a text with its different witnesses under study. For the computer-aided creation of a critical apparatus, there have been established approaches and tools for many years. However, they mainly focus on subsentences or sentences. An efficient and easy-to-use automatic comparison of entire chapters or books still represents a research desideratum. The Locate, Explore, Retrace and Apprehend complex text variants (LERA) working environment presented here solves this issue. It is based on a two-stage collation approach: an efficient, fully automatic alignment of text segments, which can be paragraphs, subparagraphs or sentences, with interactive post-processing options, followed by the detailed comparison at segment level. Because aligning text segments, such as paragraphs, for more than two text witnesses is algorithmically challenging, we discuss the heuristics we developed in more detail. LERA combines the entire process of document management, tokenization/segmentation, normalization, alignment, and visualization with interactive control options and exploratory tools. It has already been and is being successfully applied in several Digital Humanities projects of different languages, e.g. for Arabic, French, Hebrew as well as German and English texts.},

  abstract = {The Dead Sea Scrolls are tangible evidence of the Bible's ancient scribal culture. This study takes an innovative approach to palaeography---the study of ancient handwriting---as a new entry point to access this scribal culture. One of the problems of palaeography is to determine writer identity or difference when the writing style is near uniform. This is exemplified by the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa               a               ). To this end, we use pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques to innovate the palaeography of the scrolls and to pioneer the microlevel of individual scribes to open access to the Bible's ancient scribal culture. We report new evidence for a breaking point in the series of columns in this scroll. Without prior assumption of writer identity, based on point clouds of the reduced-dimensionality feature-space, we found that columns from the first and second halves of the manuscript ended up in two distinct zones of such scatter plots, notably for a range of digital palaeography tools, each addressing very different featural aspects of the script samples. In a secondary, independent, analysis, now assuming writer difference and using yet another independent feature method and several different types of statistical testing, a switching point was found in the column series. A clear phase transition is apparent in columns 27--29. We also demonstrated a difference in distance variances such that the variance is higher in the second part of the manuscript. Given the statistically significant differences between the two halves, a tertiary, post-hoc analysis was performed using visual inspection of character heatmaps and of the most discriminative Fraglet sets in the script. Demonstrating that two main scribes, each showing different writing patterns, were responsible for the Great Isaiah Scroll, this study sheds new light on the Bible's ancient scribal culture by providing new, tangible evidence that ancient biblical texts were not copied by a single scribe only but that multiple scribes, while carefully mirroring another scribe's writing style, could closely collaborate on one particular manuscript.},

Frontiers borders, edges: liminal challenges to the hegemony of exclusion. Australian Geographical Studies 39, 233--245.] has referred to as frontier imaginings: the carving out of the Australian physical and socio-cultural landscape into familiar, settled, and productive spaces. These frontier imaginaries have been leveraged to exact social control and `zealously order rural space' [Philo, C., 1992. Neglected rural geographies: a review. Journal of Rural Studies 8, 193--207, 197]. Government policy has historically been imbued with frontier imaginaries, privileging population movements that are constructed as appropriately bounded, and disciplining those which are not. Much Indigenous mobility falls into the latter category. This paper tells a story of competing rationalities about the purpose and nature of rural `settlement', both past and present, and the implications of these rationalities for contemporary Indigenous population dynamics. In so doing, it creates a discursive space for examining the cultural content and hidden assumptions in constructions of appropriate `settlement patterns'. Ultimately, it speaks of spatial struggles across the Australian geographical and temporal landscape. It also opens windows onto the fragile geographies of co-existence that need to be engaged with to shift the discourses of rural livelihood and well being toward discourses of accommodation, recognition and sustainable ways of being together.},

  abstract = {Around the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C., after the end of the first Babylonian dynasty, there is a chronological gap in all of our information from Mesopotamia, the Dark Age, which makes it impossible to establish the absolute chronology of the earlier half of the millennium and before. Only relative dates can be provided prior to c.1430/1420 B.C. The central problem of Mesopotamian chronology is the dating of the first Babylonian dynasty. Attempts have been made to compute an absolute date for this dynasty by means of the ``Venus Tablet'' written, it would seem, during the reign of the Old Babylonian King Ammisaduqa. But the data in the table is difficult to interpret and has resulted in three chronologies, the high, the middle and the low. This ``introduction'' to the chronology of 2nd millennium Mesopotamia includes the topics which form the basis for chronological discussions, such as the dating methods and calendars of Mesopotamia, relevant sources for Mesopotamian chronology and natural science information. Each chronological topic is discussed in a separate chapter. The topics, \- hence chapters, \- are arranged alphabetically, not in order of importance: the chronological importance of each topic is considered in a summary at the end of each chapter. Chapter 1 starts with an overview of the problems of 2nd millennium Mesopotamian chronology. Throughout the book previous research in the individual topics is reviewed at some length with constant reference to the relevant publications and related topics. This book is not an argument for any of the currently proposed chronologies, but an extensive and critical review of existing studies. It is hoped that it will offer insights into the current state of chronological research in Ancient Near Eastern studies and will stimulate further research.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graphs provide a powerful representation of entities and the relationships between them, but automatically constructing such graphs from noisy extractions presents numerous challenges. Knowledge graph identification (KGI) is a technique for knowledge graph construction that jointly reasons about entities, attributes and relations in the presence of uncertain inputs and ontological constraints. Although knowledge graph identification shows promise scaling to knowledge graphs built from millions of extractions, increasingly powerful extraction engines may soon require knowledge graphs built from billions of extractions. One tool for scaling is partitioning extractions to allow reasoning to occur in parallel. We explore approaches which leverage ontological information and distributional information in partitioning. We compare these techniques with hash-based approaches, and show that using a richer partitioning model that incorporates the ontology graph and distribution of extractions provides superior results. Our results demonstrate that partitioning can result in order-of-magnitude speedups without reducing model performance.},

  abstract = {Despite the capacity of Virtual Reality (VR) to recreate and enhance real and virtual worlds, many applications in Archaeology aim at the photorealistic depiction of architectural spaces. On the other hand, little is known about their real communicational effectiveness. In this context, the EU-funded project \{LEAP] proposed the concept of Cultural Presence as the theoretical and methodological foundation for a new kind of VR-mediated experience, and the UNESCO World Heritage Neolithic site of {\c C}atalh{\"o}y{\"u}k (Turkey) was chosen as case of application. During this process, a survey of design pipelines in Digital Archaeology indicated that, to build such experiences, a new design and evaluation method may need to be adopted. This paper presents the process of building and testing ``3D{$\cdot$}CoD'', a new methodology for the design of VR-mediated experiences. Initially, different archaeologists working at {\c C}atalh{\"o}y{\"u}k were engaged in a first workshop, aimed at establishing a specific instantiation of Cultural Presence and how to depict it by means of VR. To that end, observation, questionnaires, multimodal, and statistical analyses were used. The results of this field work were translated into a co-design hands-on methodology (``3D{$\cdot$}CoD''), which was tested in a second workshop, with a different group of archaeologists. In this case, observation and debriefing were used. The results of this evaluation suggest that co-design strategies are suitable for the creation of VR-mediated experiences, but that equally important is 1) to consider the co-designers' concept of Archaeology; and 2) to think in terms, not of 3D models, but of Cultural Heritage goals and human experiences.\vphantom\}},

This model is built up within a computer by ``recoding'' a body of information from an ordinary dictionary into a complex network of elements and associations interconnecting them. Then, the ability of a program to use the resulting model memory effectively for simulating human performance provides a test of its design. One simulation program, now running, is given the model memory and is required to compare and contrast the meanings of arbitrary pairs of English words. For each pair, the program locates any relevant semantic information within the model memory, draws inferences on the basis of this, and thereby discovers various relationships between the meanings of the two words. Finally, it creates English text to express its conclusions. The design principles embodied in the memory model, together with some of the methods used by the program, constitute a theory of how human memory for semantic and other conceptual material may be formatted, organized, and used.},

  abstract = {Excessive irrigation and poor drainage conditions are the major factors contributing to rising groundwater tables and soil salinity in the irrigated areas of Central Iraq. Therefore calculations of precise irrigation requirements are necessary to optimize crop production and keep the groundwater table below the root zone to avoid soil salinization. In this study, the soil--water--atmosphere--plant (SWAP) model is used to determine optimal groundwater table depth and irrigation amounts for the study area. SWAP was calibrated using field data from the study area during the wheat and maize season of 2011--2012. The modelling results reveal that under current irrigation practices (600 mm to wheat and 1000 mm to maize), more than 30\% water is lost as deep percolation. This causes a rise in the groundwater table and reduction in crop yields. The model simulations suggest that a groundwater table depth of 200 cm together with an irrigation application of 500 mm to wheat and 600 mm to maize will be the best combination to attain optimal yields. Therefore a drainage system in these areas should be installed to maintain groundwater table depth around 200 cm. Maintaining adeeper groundwater table will not be suitable as costs will increase and crop responses negligible. For long-term sustainability, rehabilitation of existing drainage systems to evacuate excessive salts from the root zone will be imperative. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this comprehensive primary source reader, Martha Rampton traces the history of our fascination with magic and witchcraft from the first through to the seventeenth century. In over 80 readings presented chronologically, Rampton demonstrates how understandings of and reactions toward magic changed and developed over time, and how these ideas were influenced by various factors such as religion, science, and law. The wide-ranging texts emphasize social history and include early Merovingian law codes, the Picatrix, Lombard's Sentences, The Golden Legend, and A Midsummer Night's Dream. By presenting a full spectrum of source types including hagiography, law codes, literature, and handbooks, this collection provides readers with a broad view of how magic was understood through the medieval and early modern eras. Rampton's introduction to the volume is a passionate appeal to students to use tolerance, imagination, and empathy when travelling back in time. The introductions to individual readings are deliberately minimal, providing just enough context so that students can hear medieval voices for themselves},

Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes.

To document this evidence, we provide here one method of conducting drone-based photogrammetry and GIS mapping from within these digital spaces based on well-established methods conducted in physical landscapes. Mapping is an integral part of archaeology in the natural world, but it has largely eluded researchers in these new, populated digital landscapes. We hope that our proposed method helps to resolve this issue. We argue that employing archaeological methods in digital environments provides a successful methodological framework to investigate human agency in digital spaces for anthropological purposes and has the potential for extrapolating data from human-digital landscape interactions and applying them to their natural analogues. ,  En la {\'u}ltima d{\'e}cada, los arque{\'o}logos han estado utilizando entornos construidos digitales interactivos ocupados por humanos para investigar la agencia, el asentamiento y el comportamiento humanos.

  abstract = {Patterns are an essential part of music and there are many different algorithms that aim to discover them. Based on the improvements brought by using data fusion methods to find the consensus of algorithms on other MIR tasks, we hypothesize that fusing the output from musical pattern discovery algorithms will improve the pattern discovery results. In this paper, we explore two methods to combine the pattern output from ten state-of-the-art algorithms using two datasets. Both provide human-annotated patterns as ground truth. We show that finding the consensus among the output of different musical pattern discovery algorithms is challenging for two reasons: First, the number of patterns found by the algorithms exceeds patterns in human annotations by several orders of magnitude, with little agreement on what constitutes a pattern. Second, the algorithms perform inconsistently across different pieces. We show that algorithms lack a consensus with each other. Therefore, it is difficult to harness the collective wisdom of the algorithms to find ground truth patterns. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-analysis of the (dis)similarities among pattern discovery algorithms' output and using the output in two fusion methods. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of our results for the MIREX task.},

Noch immer fu{\ss}t die Schriftlinguistik auf unsoliden theoretischen Grundlagen: So sind f{\"u}r das Graphem zwei verschiedene, einander widersprechende Definitionen in Gebrauch, die oft sogar miteinander vermischt werden. Zudem ersch{\"o}pft sich die Graphematik, reduziert auf die Rolle einer Hilfswissenschaft der Orthographie, traditionell in der Betrachtung von Graphem-Phonem-Korrespondenzen und ignoriert in der Folge alle schriftlichen Erscheinungen, die nicht mit diesem Instrumentarium zu erfassen sind -- etwa Zeichen wie {$<$}?{$>$} oder {$<$}5{$>$} oder {$<$}@{$>$}, die unerl{\"a}sslicher und selbstverst{\"a}ndlicher Teil des t{\"a}glichen Schriftgebrauchs sind. Und die vielf{\"a}ltigen Formen von Allographie werden allenfalls als Randerscheinung erw{\"a}hnt, anstatt sie als Ph{\"a}nomen zu begreifen, das nach Systematisierung verlangt. Eine so betriebene Graphematik wird ihrer Aufgabe, das Schriftsystem des Deutschen vollst{\"a}ndig zu erfassen, nicht gerecht. Ursache und zugleich Ausdruck dieses Missstandes ist das unzul{\"a}ngliche, gleichwohl etablierte Modell, das nur zwei Arten hierarchisierter Einheiten kennt: Grapheme und Graphen.  Zur Revision und Fortentwicklung dieses Modells formuliert die vorliegende Arbeit einen Graphembegriff, der zwischen kleinsten schriftlichen Einheiten und phonemabbildenden Einheiten unterscheidet und auch Nichtbuchstaben ins System inkorporiert. Zehn verschiedene Erscheinungsformen von Allographie werden klassifiziert und insbesondere jene aufschlussreichen F{\"a}lle betrachtet, in denen die Wahl einer Verschriftungsvariante nicht orthographisch festgelegt, sondern von Einfl{\"u}ssen anderer linguistischer Ebenen gelenkt ist -- etwa vom grammatischen Umfeld, lexikalischen Bez{\"u}gen oder medialen Bedingungen. Besonderes Gewicht wird auf die Graphetik gelegt: Die {\"a}u{\ss}ere Form von Schriftzeichen wird in der Linguistik oft v{\"o}llig ausgeblendet -- dabei ist es ja gerade die Physis, die Schrift ausmacht. Diese Arbeit versucht indes, auch typographische Aspekte in die Linguistik einzubringen, denn in einigen Belangen erweist sich auch die Gestalt von Schriftzeichen als systematisch relevant. Als Ergebnis all dieser Er{\"o}rterungen wird das etablierte Strukturmodell auf vier hierarchisierte Beschreibungsebenen erweitert, deren Einheiten tentativ als Phonemabbilder, Grapheme, Grundformen und Graphen bezeichnet werden.}

This first part of a two-part paper replicates the method's success in attributing complete plays but demonstrates that it cannot be relied on to attribute individual scenes correctly, particularly where Marlowe is a candidate author. It shows by examining the method's calculations that its unreliability is due to its mass exclusion of relevant evidence, that exclusion being necessitated by its use of a mathematical formula which can now be seen to be unsuited to the texts of early modern plays.},

By doing control experiments, it shows that the attributions made by the method are not due to distinctive word adjacencies at all, contrary to the claim of its inventors. It shows that the method is in fact another word-counting method, the counting hidden by superfluously complicated mathematics. It concludes that the claim that the placements of function words in a text can be used for attributing its authorship remains unsubstantiated.

Editors are interested in the text as it appears line-by-line in each document, and in how the versions of the text differ from document to document. It is useful to define a text as the record of an act of communication, inscribed in a document: thus, the instance of the act of communication we identify as Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, as it appears in the Hengwrt manuscript. In this view, every text has a dual aspect: it is both the words as they are inscribed in a particular document, and as they constitute an act of communication and its parts. This presents challenges for scholars who wish to record both aspects. In encoding implementations, these two aspects are commonly treated as `overlapping hierarchies'. However, the `overlapping hierarchy' model does not deal with cases where text segments are not contiguous in either aspect and cannot overlap cleanly. To meet these cases, the Textual Communities project developed an architecture in which the two aspects are represented as distinct and independent hierarchies (trees), with text segments referenced to nodes on each tree. The linking of text segments to the two trees is managed by a JSON database, accessed through transcription and collation tools presented in a Web interface. Textual Communities does not implement the whole of this architecture in terms of validation, ingestion, and processing. Full exploration and implementation of the architecture here described are challenges for future scholars.},

It permits mounting of document images and offers page-by-page transcription and display, with the facility for project leaders to recruit and manage transcribers and other contributors, allocating and reviewing transcription work as it is done. Most distinctively, Textual Communities is built on a comprehensive model of scholarly editing, enabling both ``document'' (page-by-page) and ``work'' (intellectual structure, or ``entity'') views of the texts edited. Accordingly, multiple texts of a single work, or part of a work (an entity) may be extracted and compared, using an embedded installation of CollateX. While completely conformant with Text Encoding Initiative guidelines, Textual Communities goes beyond TEI and XML in its ability to handle multiple overlapping hierarchies within texts. This paper will outline the thinking behind the development of Textual Communities, and show examples of its use by several major projects.}

Yet this may only be a prelude to a much greater challenge: the making of what may be called fluid, co-operative and distributed editions. These editions will not be made or maintained by one person or by one group, but by a community of scholars and readers working together: they will be the work of many and the property of all. This approach will strain currently deployed data and organizational models, and will demand rethinking of some of the fundamental practices of the academy.

  abstract = {Since the advent of Assyriology in the early nineteenth century it has been known that two distinct scripts were used in ancient Mesopotamian inscriptions and documents. One, usefully characterized as "cursive," was used for the ephemeral documents of "daily life" as well as on most library and archival texts. The other was a deliberately archaizing script reserved for ceremonial use. This ceremonial script, of Babylonian origin, contained both archaic and archaizing signs, and was in productive use for over two millennia, not only in Babylonia but occasionally also in Assyria and beyond. Yet to date there has been no systematic study devoted specifically to this ceremonial script, nor any published syllabary of the archaic and archaizing signs it employs. This volume attempts to rectify this deficiency by providing a substantive introduction to Babylonian ceremonial script, along with a history of its modern study, and several case studies of how the script was actually used. The introduction is supplemented by an edition of the paleographic lists of the second and first millennia BCE, which contain pedagogical inventories of the archaic and archaizing cuneiform signs, illustrating how the ceremonial script was taught, learned and transmitted in scholarly contexts.},

  abstract = {The interdisciplinary project ``Between Land and Sea'' combines geological, geomorphological and paleo-environmental approaches to identify archaeological remains of the Chekka region (Lebanon). In order to record the topography of this area, the first ever scientific airborne LiDAR data acquisition in Lebanon was conducted in autumn 2018. This work describes not only the acquisition and processing of the LiDAR data, but also the attempt to derive possible archaeological sites from the generated elevation model based on methods for spatial analysis. Using an ``inverted mound'' (iMound) algorithm, areas of possible settlement structures could be identified, which were classified regarding their probability of a possible ancient site using a deductive predictive model. A preliminary validation of some of the detected favoured areas using high-resolution aerial images has shown that the methods applied can provide hints to previously undiscovered sites. It was possible to identify probable ancient wall remains at several detected locations. In addition, least-cost path analyses were performed to reconstruct possible trade and transport routes from the Lebanon Mountains to the Mediterranean coast. The combination of the results of the iMound detection and classification as well as the calculated path system could point to the strategic location of the modern village of Kfar Hazir as a kind of traffic junction. Moreover, reconstructed main transport routes provide indications of heavily frequented roads and may form the basis for further investigations. To validate the results, upcoming field surveys will be realized on site.},

As part of the expansion process into territories of Upper Mesopotamia, Neo-Assyrian rulers (ca. 900--600 BCE) relied on settled agriculture to produce and promote imperial subjects bound to the authorities for whom they tilled and toiled. However, archaeobotanical data from Tu{\v s}han, a provincial capital of the empire, reveals that people under Neo-Assyria's control did not fully conform to the idealized agrarian lifeways construed by officials to uphold Assyrian power and dictate subject conduct. Evidence for semi-nomadic pastoralism at Tu{\v s}han exposes the slippage between ideal agrarian subject and actual agrarian practice in the Neo-Assyrian empire, wherein lies the contestation over politically oriented subjectivities and their instantiation through land-use.},

The demographics of potters and the division of labour often remain enigmatic in current cha{\^i}ne op{\'e}ratoire research. A growing number of biometric studies have demonstrated the potential of fingerprints preserved on ceramic surfaces for classifying the age and sex of potters. In this paper, we use a recently introduced identification matrix to model labour divisions based on 52 fingerprints preserved on a diverse range of objects from the Late Bronze Age II stratum at Tel Burna. The sample includes objects from the recently exposed cultic enclosure. Based on broad ethnographic considerations, women were the principal potters in Canaanite society. Our study tests this hypothesis with regards to who made pottery for cultic use. We identify patterns in age categories and a sexual division of labour for the manufacture of select objects and vessel types. The results lead us to discuss possible effects of imperialism on labour organisation. We provide the first compelling insights into the social relations of pottery production at a time when Egypt exercised hegemony over the city-states of the Southern Levant.},

This paper will discuss the computation and quantification procedures as related to the administration of irrigation systems in Southern Mesopotamia in the third millennium BCE. The largest and the most detailed corpus of such administrative texts derives from the highly bureaucratic Ur III state (2112--2004 BCE) that controlled an area roughly corresponding to modern Southern Iraq at the end of the third millennium BCE. Texts discussed in this paper provide insight into one of the earliest examples of geographic surveys by which the natural environment was translated into quantifiable units, necessary to compute workloads, labor demands and the division of the work amongst different social groups and state institutions. It has been proposed that Ur III bookkeeping served to keep track of the fulfillment of a province's tax obligations and/or was the result of a planned economy. However, this paper suggests that it equally functioned as a means to streamline the workflow associated with the upkeep and operation of irrigation systems.},

  abstract = {"Irrigation has long been of interest in the study of the past. Many early civilizations were located in river valleys, and irrigation was of great economic importance for many early states because of the key role it played in producing an agricultural surplus, which was the main source of wealth and the basis of political power for the elites who controlled it. Agricultural surplus was also necessary to maintain the very features of statehood, such as urbanism, full-time labor specialization, state institutions, and status hierarchy. Yet, the presence of large-scale or complex irrigation systems does not necessarily mean that they were under centralized control. While some early states organized the construction, operation, and maintenance of irrigation works and resolved conflicts related to water distribution, other early governments left most of the management to local farmers and controlled only the surplus. The cross-cultural studies in this volume reexamine the role of irrigation in early states. Ranging geographically from South America and the southwestern United States to North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, they describe the physical attributes and environments of early irrigation systems; various methods for empirical investigation of ancient irrigation; and irrigation's economic, sociopolitical, and cosmological dimensions. Through their interdisciplinary perspectives, the authors-all experts in the field of irrigation studies-advance both methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding irrigation in early civilizations"--},

  abstract = {Participatory mapping has become an indispensable tool in the struggle of indigenous peoples to claim their rights to land and resources. It has also, however, come under criticism for its potential to increase state regulation, replace indigenous conceptions of territory and property, and to create conflict. This paper starts from the premise that the problem is not mapping per se, but the conception of abstract space we allow to frame and guide our representation of indigenous territories, resource use and management. The development of a more effective participatory mapping practice thus requires a critical engagement with the conception of space that participatory mappers are attempting to map. Using research conducted in two Karen communities in Thailand, this paper develops a conception of `dwelling space' meant to better capture the complex spatiality of indigenous resource use and serve as a potential alternative to abstract space. I conclude by arguing for a renewed practice of community-based mapping that takes seriously the spatial complexity of indigenous territory.},

Earmarked for a 20,000~m2 site at Al Manar in the marshes between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, near a probable site of the historic Garden of Eden, Eden in Iraq is a project that brings, art, design, and technology together with culture and history. Drawing on Islamic and Mesopotamian traditions originating in this historically and symbolically charged region, the Eden in Iraq Waste Water Garden is designed to be a syncretic container for ecological and cultural restoration and heritage after the time of war. This paper looks at this project from three inter-related activities, namely, treatment of wastewater suitable for growing a large scale garden, design of the garden starting from the Islamic garden design principles and thirdly, reviving the cultural heritage of the pre-Islamic, Mesopotamian art in contemporary forms.},

The maps depict the biblical borders of the Holy Land, the allotments of the tribes, and the forty years of wanderings in the desert. Most of these maps are in Hebrew although there are several in Yiddish, Ladino and in European languages.  The book focuses on four aspects: it presents an up-to-date corpus of known maps of various types and genres; it suggests a classification of these maps according to their source, shape and content; it presents and analyses the main topics that were depicted in the maps; and it puts the maps in their historical and cultural contexts, both within the Jewish world and the sphere of European cartography of their time.  The book is an innovative contribution to the fields of history of cartography and Jewish studies. It is written for both professional readers and the general public. The Hebrew edition (2014), won the Izhak Ben-Zvi Prize.},

Der Blick auf die Stadt als Hort der S{\"a}kularisierung ist durch neue Formen religi{\"o}ser Pr{\"a}senz, Debatten um Religion als kulturelles Erbe, durch blutige Pogrome und Erfahrungen der ,,fundamentalistischen Stadt'' ersch{\"u}ttert worden. Der Blick auf Religion und Stadt in der Antike durch die Linse von Numa Fustel de Coulange kann einen unerwarteten Beitrag zur gegenw{\"a}rtige Debatte liefern: n{\"a}mlich dann, wenn man einen verengten Blick auf Polisreligion als Staatsreligion {\"u}berwindet. Der Aufsatz will die These plausibilisieren, dass religi{\"o}se Praktiken und Vorstellungen wichtig f{\"u}r die Stabilisierung und weitere Verbreitung von St{\"a}dten in der Antike waren und sich Religion und Urbanit{\"a}t als zwei Seiten einer Medaille entwickelt haben. In diesem Sinne wird eine Weiterentwicklung des Begriffs ,,urban religion'' als ,,urbanisierte Religion`` vorgeschlagen.}

Such methodology offers an interesting quantitative viewpoint on the study of the lexicography of long-extinct languages. This chapter explores the use of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), a well-known statistical word association measure used in collocation analysis. PMI is applied to the data in order to gain insights on the semantic nuances of Akkadian verbs of seeing (am{\=a}ru, na{\d t}{\=a}lu, pal{\=a}su, dag{\=a}lu, ḫi{\=a}tu, bar{\^u}, and subb{\^u}). To evaluate the data-driven results, the findings are compared to previous philological work by Ainsley Dicks. The analysis of the top-ranked PMI-extracted collocates provides a good overview of the typical semantic differences between the seven verbs of interest.},

Testing our method, we observed that anything above 90\% OCR accuracy is sufficient for semantic analysis. In addition, the overall homogeneity in the OCR accuracy across the corpus proved to be more important than having perhaps only a few works with higher accuracy and the rest available in a lower quality. In terms of the OCR process, this paper illustrates how it was possible to reduce the processing time at maximum quality of a single book of average length (ca. 500 pages) from a minimum of 20 hrs to an average of about 3 hrs (though theoretically nearly infinitely reducible). This was achieved by replacing a step-by-step OCR process with a fully automated pipeline system run on an arbitrary number of servers, breaking up the full process of OCRing one book into minimal tasks that can be handled simultaneously by multiple servers.},

  abstract = {In this article we make a case for a systematic application of complex network science to study art market history and more general collection dynamics. We reveal social, temporal, spatial, and conceptual network dimensions, i.e. network node and link types, previously implicit in the Getty Provenance Index (GPI). As a pioneering art history database active since the 1980s, the GPI provides online access to source material relevant for research in the history of collecting and art markets. Based on a subset of the GPI, we characterize an aggregate of more than 267,000 sales transactions connected to roughly 22,000 actors in four countries over 20 years at daily resolution from 1801 to 1820. Striving towards a deeper understanding on multiple levels we disambiguate social dynamics of buying, brokering, and selling, while observing a general broadening of the market, where large collections are split into smaller lots. Temporally, we find annual market cycles that are shifted by country and obviously favor international exchange. Spatially, we differentiate near-monopolies from regions driven by competing sub-centers, while uncovering asymmetries of international market flux. Conceptually, we track dynamics of artist attribution that clearly behave like product categories in a very slow supermarket. Taken together, we introduce a number of meaningful network perspectives dealing with historical art auction data, beyond the analysis of social networks within a single market region. The results presented here have inspired a Linked Open Data conversion of the GPI, which is currently in process and will allow further analysis by a broad set of researchers.},

  abstract = {The digitisation of cultural heritage and linguistics texts has long been troubled by the problem of how to represent overlapping structures arising from different markup perspectives (`overlapping hierarchies') or from different versions of the same work (`textual variation'). These two problems can be reduced to one by observing that every case of overlapping hierarchies is also a case of textual variation. Overlapping textual structures can be accurately modelled either as a minimally redundant directed graph, or, more practically, as an ordered list of pairs, each containing a set of versions and a fragment of text or data. This `pairs-list' representation is provably equivalent to the graph representation. It can record texts consisting of thousands of versions or perspectives without becoming overloaded with data, and the most common operations on variant text, e.g. comparison between two versions, can be performed in linear time. This representation also separates variation or other overlapping structures from the document content, leading to a simplification of markup suitable for wiki-like web applications.},

The Ugaritic language and literature was a precursor to Canaanite and serves as one of our most important resources for understanding the Old Testament and the Hebrew language. Special emphasis is placed on contextualization of the Ugaritic language and comparison to ancient Hebrew as well as Akkadian. The book begins with a general introduction to ancient Ugarit, and the introduction to the various genres of Ugaritic literature is placed in the context of this introduction. The language is introduced by genre, beginning with prose and letters, proceeding to administrative, and finally introducing the classic examples of Ugaritic epic. A summary of the grammar, a glossary, and a bibliography round out the volume.},

The earliest cuneiform evidence for fully-developed irrigation networks stems from royal inscriptions and archival records from a temple archive from the city-state of Laga{\textasciicaron}s, ca. 2475--2315 BC. These sources testify to a four-level irrigation network, probably established upon the unification of the state by Urnan{\textasciicaron}se and Eanatum. From the river, water flowed to primary canals with regulators, and from there branched off to secondary canals. Distributors regulated the water flow to the fields. The construction of primary canals and regulators was conducted by the ruler who drew on the corv{\'e}e troops of the temples. The temples maintained the lower-level irrigation structures, such as the distributors and dikes in their fields.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter discusses the foundations and inner structure of the kingdom of Akkad. Based mainly on royal inscriptions and archival records, it argues that this state constitutes a decisive phase in Mesopotamian history and discusses a series of political, ideological, socioeconomic, and administrative transformations that it brought about: the implementation of the concept of the territorial state, borne by an autocratic and conquering kingship with absolute claim to power; an administrative centralization directed toward the capital; the introduction of Akkadian as an official language of administration; and the spread of private landownership, concentrated in the hands of the king and administered through large agricultural estates established throughout the state through purchase and confiscation. These transformations were implemented by means of the standing army, whose upkeep was supported by the agricultural land in the hands of the king. Allocations of royally owned land to other parties established a far-flung network of patronage, which included not only members of the royal family, court, administration, and army but also members of the local elites, thus strengthening the king's power base. The chapter also discusses how the transformations brought about by the kingdom of Akkad were ambiguously reflected in later tradition, which also made this state a model to be emulated by later rulers.},

Among the recent trends I describe are changes in our conceptions of organization boundaries, strategies, and controls, and the beginning of a shift from an entity-based to a process-based view of organization. Evidence of success---the number of sociologists now employed in professional schools---simultaneously raises concerns about the source of future organizational sociologists.},

Upon returning to his home in Europe, crusading knight Behmen (Cage) finds his faith beginning to falter due to the brutality he's witnessed on the battlefield. The Black Plague has decimated the countryside, forcing Behmen and his loyal companion, Felson (Perlman), to seek sustenance and supplies at the Palace of Marburg. They're weary from war, but they're about to discover that their struggle is just beginning. Commanded by the moribund Cardinal to deliver a suspected witch to the abbey where her powers can be abolished, Behman accepts the assignment under the condition that the young peasant girl will receive a fair trial. The church believes the girl to be the one responsible for the Black Plague, and they may be right, too. As the two men and a small group of chaperones set out on their arduous mission, they quickly realize that their young charge is something more than human, and that they're about to face an evil beyond human comprehension"--Allmovie.com, viewed October 12, 2018},

  abstract = {The contribution of the Indus Valley civilization to the historic cultures of South Asia is a matter of debate due to a discontinuity in material culture, from the time of its decline to the reappearance of urbanization several centuries later. Progress in the epigraphy of the Indus Valley has been hindered by the absence of a bilingual inscription and the brevity of its texts. One of the most frequent signs encountered in its undeciphered writing system is the pictogram of `fish'. On a few seal inscriptions, this sign appears alone, suggesting that it represented a meaningful word or a name. It is noteworthy that Indian literature of later centuries recounts a protohistoric kingdom named Matsya in the vicinity of the Indus Valley sites, as matsya is the Sanskrit word for `fish' and a divinity in the form of a fish is celebrated in the Indian version of the flood myth. An analysis of these narratives is presented in this paper, revealing the possibility of an association with the Indus Valley civilization of the more distant past. These observations indicate that fish symbolism may have occupied a place of prominence in Indus culture from political and religious perspectives. The Matsya territory mentioned in Vedic and epic literature is discussed in light of the chalcolithic cultures of Rajasthan, and it is suggested that this region witnessed successive waves of migration of different cultural groups due to its economic importance related to the exploitation of copper reserves.},

  abstract = {As medieval manuscripts often consist of more than one text, the application of network analysis can show textual connections between codices and therefore shed light on the circulation of texts, of manuscripts, and thus of knowledge. However, a text-based analysis often faces difficulties resulting from insufficient manuscript descriptions and a lack of normalization of work titles. A broader view, which would compare not particular texts, but rather genres, areas of interest or fields of knowledge, may help to circumvent these problems; however, this broader approach must deal with problems regarding classification. Instead of finding connections between subjectively classified texts, one can make use of topic modeling as a means to computationally classify, and thus characterize, multiple-text manuscripts. On the basis of automatically detected topics, topic-based networks can be generated. The current potential of such an analysis was tested using a sample of codices that contain the late medieval chronicle of Jakob Twinger von K{\"o}nigshofen. Advancements in text recognition and normalization of non-standardized spelling could further enhance this method to investigate the connections between the codices of a specific corpus and develop a better understanding of the copying and transmission of premodern manuscripts.},

So writes Peter Shillingsburg in his introduction to this series of meditations on the possibilities of deriving "meaning" from the texts we read. Shillingsburg argues that as humans we are and always will be interested in the past, in what was meant, in what was revealed inadvertently by a text--and that is all to the good. But we learn more and can compare notes better when we understand the principles that govern the ways we read. Resisting Texts approaches crucial questions about the practice of textual editing and literary criticism by posing questions in the form "If we take such and such to be the goal of our reading, then what will follow from that assumption?" With humor and a lively imagination, Shillingsburg takes the reader on a fresh theoretical investigation of communication, understanding and misunderstanding, and textual satisfactions, drawing examples from Thackeray, Wordsworth, Melville, and others. Resisting Texts will appeal to all who enjoy the varieties of critical approaches to the written word. Peter L. Shillingsburg is Professor of English, University of North Texas.},

Beginning with a typological formulation of electronic scholarly editions, activities common to humanities scholars who engage with texts as expert readers are considered, noting that many methods of engagement both reflect the interrelated nature of long-standing professional reading strategies and are social in nature; extending this frame work, the next steps in the scholarly edition's development in its incorporation of social media functionality reflect the importance of traditional humanistic activities and workflows, and include collaboration, incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning the role of the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward that of facilitator of reader involvement. Intended to provide a `toolkit' for academic consideration, this discussion of the emerging social edition points to new methods of textual engagement in digital literary studies and is accompanied by two integral, detailed appendices, published in Digital Humanities Quarterly under the title `Pertinent discussions toward modeling the social edition: Annotated bibliographies' (http:// www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000111/000111.html): one addressing issues pertinent to online reading and interaction, and another on social networking tools.}

  abstract = {This article discusses the multiscale nature of modelling in archaeology and its relationship with higher-level spatial analysis. The application and purpose of modelling in archaeology is as varied as the multidisciplinary field itself. With the increasing integration of geographical information systems (GIS) and other digital methods into the archaeological workflow, both new opportunities and potential pitfalls present themselves. The struggle of balancing informal inferences of human behaviour in a formal system, such as GIS, has been the subject of much discussion, as well as the questioning of whether some modelling tasks would be better suited for implementation outside the GIS environment. Higher-level spatial analysis is dependent on a number of lower-level models, each building on the other, inheriting both information and uncertainties. These nuances can be difficult to demonstrate clearly once they have been incorporated into another model, potentially obscured further when restricted by the ``geographical space'' that is central to GIS. Rather than forcing informal models into a formal environment, an alternative would be to opt instead for the visualization of these within the more flexible ``variable space,'' where the data are front and centre, and spatial and temporal concepts can function as a means of explaining patterns in the model. This article discusses aspects of the challenges and opportunities involved in these types of analysis and provides examples of alternate approaches that could be considered non-spatial.},

We suggest that a division into such groupings can be musically meaningful, and that it can be more flexible than similar approaches. We demonstrate our representation system at work in both analysis and composition, with output from computer programs. We conclude that it is possible and useful to represent music in a way independent of the particular style, tonal system, etc., of the music itself.},

The increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and the advances in computational science have created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection. Traditional pattern recognition methods proved to have limited applicability for archaeological prospection, for a variety of reasons, including a high rate of false positives. Since 2012, however, a breakthrough has been made in the field of image recognition through deep learning. We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts. We choose to focus on qanat shafts because they are promising targets for pattern recognition and because the richness and the extent of the qanat landscapes cannot be properly captured across vast territories without automated techniques. Our project is the first effort to use automated techniques on historic satellite imagery that takes advantage of neither the spectral imagery resolution nor very high (sub-meter) spatial resolution.},

The influence of multilingualism and multiscriptism on these writing cultures becomes evident, with essays spanning various domains, from the mundane aspects of everyday life to the realms of scholarship and political propaganda. Scholars often relegate these phenomena, despite being frequently encountered, to the status of exceptions compared to the more prevalent monolingualism and monoscriptism. However, in daring to challenge this viewpoint, this book emphasises the profound significance and relevance of multilingualism and multiscriptism in shaping the development of languages, cultures, and societies across Asia, Africa, and Europe. It caters to a diverse readership keen on delving into the intricacies of these phenomena within this rich tapestry of writing cultures.},

  abstract = {Notations like SGML and XML represent document structures using tree structures; while this is in general a step forward from earlier systems, it creates certain difficulties for the representation of documents in which the structures of interest are not properly nested. Overlapping structures, discontinuous structures, and material which occurs in different orders in different parts, views, or versions of a document are all problems for SGML and XML. Overlapping structures have received attention from a variety of authors on SGML and XML, who have proposed various solutions including the use of non-SGML notations with translation into SGML for processing, the use of the CONCUR feature of SGML, exploitation of conditional marked sections in the DTD and document instance, the imposition of various kinds of unusual interpretations on SGML/XML elements as milestones or as fragments of some larger `virtual' element, or the use of detailed annotation separate from the base text being annotated. An alternative is the use of a non-SGML/XML notation which does not require that elements form a hierarchical structure. One such notation, MECS, was developed by one of the authors and has been used in practice for over a decade. Unfortunately, the element structure of a MECS document cannot conveniently be represented as a tree, so that MECS processors lack the assistance provided to SGML/XML processors by the unifying assumption of a simple standard data structure for the document. We propose a data structure for representing documents with overlapping structures (including MECS documents). As in the conventional tree representation of SGML and XML, elements are represented by nodes in a graph, and the character data content of the document by labels on the leaves of the graph. We use a directed acyclic graph in which an arc a {$\rightarrow$} b indicates that node b is a child of node a. Unlike SGML/XML trees, our graph structure allows children to have multiple parents. In the general form of the data structure, an ordering is imposed on the children of each node; this gives the data structure its name: general ordered-descendant directed acyclic graph (GODDAG). A restricted form of GODDAG, in which an ordering is imposed on the leaves of the graph, cannot handle multiple orderings of the same material but can represent any legal MECS document. The data structure here proposed should be useful in the representation of naturally occurring documents with complex structures; it may also be useful in other applications.}

We created a list of DH journals based on manual curation and bibliometric data. We used that list to identify DH publications in the bibliographic data sources under consideration. We used the ERIH-PLUS list of journals to identify Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) publications. We analysed the citation links they included to understand the relationship between DH publications and SSH and non-SSH fields. Crossref emerges as the database containing the highest number of DH publications. Citations from and to DH publications show strong connections between DH and research in Computer Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and Pedagogical \& Educational Research. Computer Science is responsible for a large part of incoming and outgoing citations to and from DH research, which suggests a reciprocal interest between the two disciplines. This is the first bibliometric study of DH research involving several bibliographic data sources, including open and proprietary databases. The list of DH journals we created might be only partially representative of broader DH research. In addition, some DH publications could have been cut off from the study since we did not consider books and other publications published in proceedings of DH conferences and workshops. Finally, we used a specific time coverage (2000--2018) that could have prevented the inclusion of additional DH publications.},

  abstract = {An authoritative edition of George Eliot's elegant translation of Spinoza's greatest philosophical work In 1856, Marian Evans completed her translation of Benedict de Spinoza's Ethics while living in Berlin with the philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes. This would have become the first edition of Spinoza's controversial masterpiece in English, but the translation remained unpublished because of a disagreement between Lewes and the publisher. Later that year, Evans turned to fiction writing, and by 1859 she had published her first novel under the pseudonym George Eliot. This splendid edition makes Eliot's translation of the Ethics available to today's readers while also tracing Eliot's deep engagement with Spinoza both before and after she wrote the novels that established her as one of English literature's greatest writers. Clare Carlisle's introduction places the Ethics in its seventeenth-century context and explains its key philosophical claims. She discusses George Eliot's intellectual formation, her interest in Spinoza, the circumstances of her translation of the Ethics , and the influence of Spinoza's ideas on her literary work. Carlisle shows how Eliot drew on Spinoza's radical insights on religion, ethics, and human emotions, and brings to light surprising affinities between Spinoza's austere philosophy and the rich fictional worlds of Eliot's novels. This authoritative edition demonstrates why George Eliot's translation remains one of the most compelling and philosophically astute renderings of Spinoza's Latin text. It includes notes that indicate Eliot's amendments to her manuscript and that discuss her translation decisions alongside more recent English editions.},

  abstract = {Museums, archives, libraries and other cultural heritage institutes maintain large collections of artefacts, which are valuable knowledge sources for both experts and interested lay persons. Recently, more and more cultural heritage institutes have started to digitise their collections, for instance to make them accessible via web portals. However, while digitisation is a necessary first step towards improved information access, to fully unlock the knowledge contained in these collections, users have to be able to easily browse, search and query these collections. This requires cleaning, linking and enriching the data, a process that is often too time-consuming to be performed manually. Information technology can help with (partially) automating this task. Because data processing and enrichment typically involve the textual metadata level, natural language processing has a key role to play in this endeavour. At the same time, cultural heritage domains pose significant challenges for language technology and call for the development of very robust and flexible solutions. Consequently, cultural heritage data can also serve as a good test-bed for the development of robust natural language processing tools.},

Constructed at various points throughout the 10th to 13th centuries CE, this network of walls, forts, and enclosures covers an estimated 4000 km and spans a wide range of ecozones, from the deserts of western China to the steppes of northern Mongolia and the Khingan mountain range. In this article we used historical atlases, topographic maps, and an array of different kinds of data derived from satellite remote sensing, to produce one of the first accurate maps of the Medieval Wall System. Through this large-scale mapping program, we are now able to evaluate previous work that estimates the length of the wall system and different areas of construction. By measuring the structures associated with the wall and the length of the wall itself, we identified at least three different areas of construction along the Medieval Wall System. Future studies may be able to use similar tools to develop more accurate maps of other wall systems throughout Eurasia to further advance the comparative study of ancient wall systems.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of textile history y including fibre, technology, tools etc, is essential and absolutely necessary for our understanding of the past. Textile research has become an important field of archaeology and has an enormous potential, being able to tell us about economic, social, chronological, and cultural aspects of past societies. Due to poor preservation conditions, few textiles have survived in the Near East. However, the few existing fragments, in combination with other sources, provide evidence of a well-developed knowledge of how to use fibres for producing textiles. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrate that several types of plant and animal fibres were used in textile production. Flax fibres and sheep wool are considered to be the two most important textile fibres from Neolithic to modern times. Information gathered from the analysis of textiles suggests that it is highly plausible that the different stages of processing fibres were similar across ancient Eurasia even if it is, of course, important to consider that different climate zones will affect both the need for and access to fibres. Archaeobotanical and zoo ostelogical material also provide information on the use of textile fibres. Additionally, different types of installations (e.g. retting pits, workshops) and textile tools (e.g. mallets, spindles, looms) would have been used and even if many tools were made of perishable materials textile tools such as spindle whorls and loom weights are well known from archaeological contexts. Therefore, this paper will give a basic framework for textile production that will provide important insights into the procurement and processing of plant and animal fibres and briefly on spinning and weaving. This will be accomplished with information from archaeological and written sources used in combination with ethnography and experimental archaeology. Les connaissances sur l'histoire du textile (fibres, technologie, outils, etc.) sont fondamentales pour notre compr{\'e}hension du pass{\'e}. La recherche sur le textile est devenue un secteur important de l'arch{\'e}ologie et pr{\'e}sente un {\'e}norme potentiel, susceptible renseigner sur l'{\'e}conomie, la chronologie et diff{\'e}rents aspects culturels des soci{\'e}t{\'e}s dupasse. En raison des conditions taphonomiques, tr{\`e}s peu de textiles ont surv{\'e}cu au Proche-Orient. N{\'e}anmoins, les quelques fragments pr{\'e}serv{\'e}s, combin{\'e}s avec d'autres sources, sugg{\`e}rent un savoir-faire d{\'e}velopp{\'e} quant {\`a} l'exploitation des fibres. Les analyses montrent en outre l'utilisation textile de plusieurs types de plantes et de fibres animales. Le lin et la laine passent pour {\^e}tre les plus importantes fibres textiles, du N{\'e}olithique aux temps modernes. Les analyses sugg{\`e}rent en outre que les diff{\'e}rentes {\'e}tapes du travail des fibres {\'e}taient semblables dans toute l'Eurasie, bien que les diff{\'e}rentes zones climatiques aient eu une incidence sur les besoins et les acc{\`e}s aux fibres. l'arch{\'e}obotanique et Varch{\'e}ozoologie informent {\'e}galement sur l'usage des textiles. Diff{\'e}rents types d'installations (fosses, ateliers, etc.) et d'outils textiles (maillets, fusa{\"i}oles, m{\'e}tiers {\`a} tisser) ont exist{\'e} et, bien que la plupart d'entre eux aient disparu du fait de leur mat{\'e}riau p{\'e}rissable, des fusa{\"i}oles et des pesons de m{\'e}tier sont bien attest{\'e}s dans les contextes arch{\'e}ologiques. Cet article propose un cadre de base pour comprendre la production textile et apporte un {\'e}clairage sur l'obtention et le travail des fibres v{\'e}g{\'e}tales et animales. On abordera plus bri{\`e}vement la question du filage et du tissage. Pour cela, des informations issues de sources arch{\'e}ologiques et {\'e}crites seront combin{\'e}es avec l'ethnographie et l'arch{\'e}ologie exp{\'e}rimentale.}

For multi-phased sites, the ability to isolate and interrogate complex layers of occupation offers exciting potential for the study of now-altered built and natural environments. While quantitative studies based on GIS data are common in the field of archaeology, this article argues that humanities-based approaches have equal importance. It is specifically the combination of spatial and temporal data that creates new access points from which to address the changing cultural meaning of place. Chronological reconstruction models allow scholars to resituate the human viewpoint into potential past environments, exploring aspects of experience that changed through time and space. Utilizing a visualization of the ancient Egyptian site of Saqqara, this work demonstrates how digital reconstructions of past landscapes address qualitative questions in innovative ways and are changing scholarship in archaeology.},

  abstract = {A graph-theoretical approach is proposed to facilitate pattern matching in post-tonal music analysis with pitch-class set theory, in which music perception is taken into account by incorporating stream segregation -- a model of the perceptual organization of music. A piece of music is modelled as a graph, with each musical note presented as a vertex and the relationship between a pair of musical notes as an edge. The relationship is determined by stream segregation. According to the proposed matching conditions, searching for a musical pattern is equivalent to searching for a special subgraph called a maximal matched CRP subgraph. The comparisons are made between the patterns identified by the graph-theoretical approach and those by the musicologists.},

The benefits of the recent developments in SAR satellite sensors towards higher resolution (up to less than 1m) and shorter revisiting times (up to a few days) are discussed in relation to established techniques using the two key SAR parameters -- amplitude and phase. Selected case studies from Middle East to South America illustrate how SAR can be effectively used to detect subtle archaeological features in modern landscapes, monitor historic sites and assess damage in areas of conflict. These examples form the basis to highlight the current trends in archaeological remote sensing based on space-borne SAR data in the era of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation and on-demand high resolution space missions such as TerraSAR-X.},

  abstract = {Humans use AI-assistance in a wide variety of high- and low-stakes decision-making tasks today. However, human reliance on the AI's assistance is often sub-optimal --- with people exhibiting under- or over-reliance on the AI. We present an empirical investigation of human-AI assisted decision-making in a noisy image classification task. We analyze the participants' reliance on AI assistance and the accuracy of human-AI assistance as compared to the human or AI working independently. We demonstrate that participants do not show automation bias which is a widely reported behavior displayed by humans when assisted by AI. In this specific instance of AI-assisted decision-making, people are able to correctly override the AI's decision when needed and achieve close to the theoretical upper bound on combined performance. We suggest that the reason for this discrepancy from previous research findings is because 1) people are experts at classifying everyday images and have a good understanding of their ability in performing the task, 2) people engage in the metacognitive act of deliberation when asked to indicate confidence in their decision, and 3) people were able to build a good mental model of the AI by incorporating feedback that was provided after each trial. These findings should inform future experiment design.},

If the universe is made of atoms, a fictional world is also made up of atomic relationships that form basic, stable configurations, or what I call narratological primes. I construct several such basic spatial buildings blocks here---diegetic density and clutter distance. Their application to a well-explored body of nineteenth-century novels challenges several long-standing historical intuitions related to the development of material culture in the nineteenth century.},

To try to address the problems of representing multiple hierarchies and of annotating existing tree structures with type information (as in the PSVI), we have developed a layered data model based on the Core Range Algebra presented at Extreme 2002 by Gavin Nichol. This data model views documents as strings over which span a number of named ranges, each of which can themselves have associated metaranges with their own internal structure. To aid our experimentation with this data model, we developed a markup notation to reflect it, the Layered Markup and Annotation Language (LMNL), and have constructed several prototype applications to facilitate the extraction of single views, as XML structures, from LMNL documents. This paper outlines LMNL and discusses how its development has made us reflect on the nature of XML, schema and query languages.}

By combining these capabilities, AI offers new insights and exciting opportunities to create knowledge from archaeological archives for contemporary and future research.

We demonstrate that this can boost the predictive and explanatory powers of, and the trust into, the learned model, using text (e.g. SVMs) and image classification (e.g. neural networks) experiments as well as a user study.},

  abstract = {The Linked Data Cloud is full of controlled resources, which in fact quickly run out of control. Firstly, each resource collection, e.g. a thesaurus, is cooking its own soup related to its research context. Secondly, conceptualisation of LOD assumes standardised data, but in reality, only generic concepts or real instances exist. Thirdly, archaeological items are usually related to generic instances in the LOD cloud, based on their object orientated nature. Describing these relations by modelling archaeological assumptions causes ambiguities which have to be tamed to guarantee data quality for reuse, demonstrated in three examples: (1) Trying to link a triangular ``lateen sail'' into the LOD cloud, a problem known from the NAVIS II ancient ship depictions database, reveals that each repository has completely different ``hidden assumptions'' in its hierarchies with respect to their scientific domain. Are the usually SKOS based relations able to solve the challenge to model also the degree of doubt? Are different methods required? (2) Trying to map pot fragments of Gaulish Terra Sigillata to historically defined concepts of ``types'' and ``service families'', or aligning these typologies, ends up in modelling doubtful assumptions. Can metrics be used to define ``type'' definitions? How can an already existing online research community help? (3) Setting up a meta-index for aligning various distributed databases at the RGZM by keywords and linking into the LOD Cloud is subject to uncertainties within the modelling of relations. As a result, this process includes dealing with the above mentioned ambiguity challenges.},

  abstract = {Since the mid-1990s the RGZM (R{\"o}misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz) provides web-based databases containing millions of datasets with content from many different archaeological disciplines. These relational databases were constructed in interdisciplinary transnational projects and include a lot of ``hidden archaeological assumptions''. The aim of our paper is to make these hidden assumptions visible and provide them as a Linked Open Data graph to establish reproducible research as a basis for Open Science. In particular the Samian Research database [1] at the RGZM which is based on the Names on Terra Sigillata project of Leeds and Reading Universities funded by the AHRC offers nearly 250'000 identified potter stamps, which are traditionally dated in a traditional way. In Roman archaeology this is usually expressed by establishing "absolute dates" in well known ``from-to'' tables, whereas in reality, the situation is much more diffuse. In fact, Samian dating is quite often based upon so-called `dated sites', which are themselves dated by Samian. Occurrences of South Gaulish Samian on ``historically dated sites'' like Hadrian's Wall with its absolute dating or the Wetteraulimes with its less clear dating are difficult to use as dating arguments because it is not possible to say a priori whether these were ``survivals'' or whether they were part of a still existing South Gaulish export industry. Therefore an RDF (Resource Description Framework) based model has been developed to deal with occurrences making the Samian dating process verifiable and transparent. This paper focuses on modelling dating arguments using a relative chronology based on Allen's interval algebra [2] compared with absolute dates in the prototypical build Academic Meta Tool [2] to create Linked Open Data for reproducible and transparent research. This tool enables the creation of an RDF-based ontology such as for modelling dating arguments and visualising the semantic reasoning for detecting errors.

This paper focuses on modelling these circular dating arguments using a relative chronology based on Allen's interval algebra for temporal reasoning in the Academic Meta Tool (AMT) to create Linked Open Data for reproducible and transparent research. AMT allows us to create a fitting ontology and visualise the reasoning results in a web app for detecting errors and circular reasoning. As an example, we will take a deeper look into the relative chronological relationships of the Limes fortresses.},

This pilot study explores the use of multi-factorial landscape and land-cover reconstruction to form a baseline physical environment for the assessment of Mesolithic movement and potential site suitability. A geographic information systems (GIS) approach to landscape reconstruction through proxy use allows for an analogue of Mesolithic land cover and extent to be generated and used to predict the potential for Mesolithic site/material remains. The integration of agent-based modelling introduces a novel investigation of pathways in the landscape, divined not with a fixed destination but with a programmed least-cost movement behaviour to extrude ``natural corridors'' of movement from the study area. Utilising the base physical characteristics of the natural environment, without introducing complex sociopolitical or economic drivers for movement promotes the use of a complex physical environment as a necessary consideration as baseline for all studies of mobility and movement. This approach also intends to present a platform to develop more universal or widely applicable models capable of providing a relevant baseline landscape for the rapid assessment and investigation of the archaeological potential of an area. Developing or understanding the role of a robust landscape permits the appropriate assessment of project utility, scale, and layering and integration of more complex input factors.},

The ultimate expression of the circular world map of the Middle Ages is found in the Ebstorf and the Hereford maps. The most common shape was the circular, disc, or wheel form, a descendant of Greco-Roman cartography, of which two distinct types can be recognized: the T-O and the climatic zonal forms. Both the T-O and the zonal types of circular world maps, which often accompany medieval manuscripts, are also found in the cartography of Islam; in some instances, both concepts are combined on a single map in Christian and in Muslim examples.},

Cette politique s'est traduite concr{\`e}tement par l'int{\'e}gration de la Babylonie {\`a} l'Iran pour former un vaste espace de nomadisation {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur duquel le Grand Roi se d{\'e}place pour asseoir son pouvoir sur les r{\'e}gions travers{\'e}es tout en tirant profit des ressources disponibles. Les migrations du roi perse et de sa cour ont {\'e}galement entra{\^i}n{\'e} des mouvements de flux vers les diff{\'e}rents centres du pouvoir en Iran et en Babylonie.},

  abstract = {Kizzuwatna was a kingdom located in south-eastern Anatolia -- roughly corresponding to modern Cilicia -- in the late second millennium BCE. Known in late 16th and 15th c. BCE textual sources as an independent polity, it was later incorporated into the Hittite kingdom, becoming a province of the vast Empire created by Suppiluliuma I (ca. mid-14th c.).  From a historical-political point of view, Kizzuwatna played a strategic role between the 15th and the early 14th c. in the clash between the Anatolian Hittite kingdom and the northern Mesopotamian kingdom of Mittani -- the hegemonic power in northern Syria and the principal rival of the Hittites in the macro-area at the time. As a `buffer'-state between the two neighbors' territories, it was involved in their diplomatic altercations and military conflicts. Kizzuwatna is also well-known in the field of Ancient Near Eastern studies for the remarkable influence which the local religious traditions and cults exerted on the Hittite kingdom's own religion and culture after its territorial incorporation. The consequence of this cultural process was a substantial transformation of the Hittite kingdom at many levels, a process which is at the basis of the New Kingdom -- as modern research has named this new historical period (ca. 1350-1200).  While these aspects emerge from the Hittite documentation, the political history of the kingdom of Kizzuwatna itself is very obscure, particularly for the absence of local written sources. Given the lack of overarching studies on this regional polity, this dissertation aims at providing a comprehensive overview on the origins, political history and historical role of this kingdom from a multidisciplinary perspective, considering both the philological and the archaeological evidence. A regional focus aims at illuminating the local trajectories in a long term perspective, within the broader context of the Ancient Near Eastern history, and in particular within the history of Anatolia under the hegemony of the Hittite kingdom.},

  abstract = {In its original edition, Bruce Trigger's book was the first ever to examine the history of archaeological thought from medieval times to the present in world-wide perspective. Now, in this new edition, he both updates the original work and introduces new archaeological perspectives and concerns. At once stimulating and even-handed, it places the development of archaeological thought and theory throughout within a broad social and intellectual framework. The successive but interacting trends apparent in archaeological thought are defined and the author seeks to determine the extent to which these trends were a reflection of the personal and collective interests of archaeologists as these relate - in the West at least - to the fluctuating fortunes of the middle classes. While subjective influences have been powerful, Professor Trigger argues that the gradual accumulation of archaeological data has exercised a growing constraint on interpretation. In turn, this has increased the objectivity of archaeological research and enhanced its value for understanding the entire span of human history and the human condition in general.},

  abstract = {Are the data of an edition means to a particular and privileged presentation, or is the presentation a side effect? Because of the changing nature of computer systems, with constant progression in hardware and software, the encoded texts are the most important long-term outcome of the project---the representation of the knowledge--- and presentation within a particular application is destined to become obsolete relatively quickly.         However, it is most often the presentation output, rather than the source data, which is published and shared. We believe this is largely because there is currently no way of expressing, in the source encoding, aspects of presentation which are seen by editors as a crucial part of their work. Given a framework for encoding processing expectations for a variety of output formats, editors would be much more inclined to share the encoded files as their prime output, and intentions for presentation would be much more likely to survive repeated technology transitions as processing tools develop and change.         We believe the collision between the individuality of research and the quest for common tools that aid in the creation of digital editions will be solved not by creating another piece of specialized publishing software but rather by creating a general framework for processing TEI documents and similar, modular solutions for other tasks in the publishing workflow. Such an abstraction layer admittedly still requires some fluency in computer technologies, but far less than for setting up a publication system from scratch in a general-purpose programming language.},

  abstract = {Though the Neo-Assyrian Empire has largely been conceived of as the main actor in relations between its core and periphery, recent work on the empire's peripheries has encouraged archaeologists and historians to consider dynamic models of interaction between Assyria and the polities surrounding it. \emph{Imperial Peripheries in the Neo-Assyrian Period} focuses on the variability of imperial strategies and local responses to Assyrian power across time and space.An international team of archaeologists and historians draws upon both new and existing evidence from excavations, surveys, texts, and material culture to highlight the strategies that the Neo-Assyrian Empire applied to manage its diverse and widespread empire as well as the mixed reception of those strategies by subjects close to and far from the center. Case studies from around the ancient Near East illustrate a remarkable variety of responses to Assyrian aggression, economic policies, and cultural influences. As a whole, the volume demonstrates both the destructive and constructive roles of empire, including unintended effects of imperialism on socioeconomic and cultural change. \emph{Imperial Peripheries in the Neo-Assyrian Period} aligns with the recent movement in imperial studies to replace global, top-down materialist models with theories of contingency, local agency, and bottom-up processes. Such approaches bring to the foreground the reality that the development and lifecycles of empires in general, and the Neo-Assyrian Empire in particular, cannot be completely explained by the activities of the core. The book will be welcomed by archaeologists of the Ancient Near East, Assyriologists, and scholars concerned with empires and imperial power in history.Contributors: Stephanie H.

In seven field seasons, it has documented a broad settlement landscape in a region of great social and political importance, especially in the Bronze and Iron Ages, including 728 archaeological sites. Its field methodology combines traditional surface collection with the use of historical aerial and satellite photographs, mobile GIS, and UAV (drone) photogrammetry. Preliminary results show some unexpected patterns: a high density of culturally Uruk settlements in the fourth millennium B.C., variable urban morphologies in the Early Bronze Age; and large but low-density settlements at the end of the Sasanian period or the early Islamic period. The project is explicitly testing several hypotheses about centralized Neo-Assyrian landscape planning in the imperial core. These hypotheses appear to be confirmed, although the situation was more complex than in surrounding provinces, probably due to the longer history of continuous settlement.           ,              المسح الأثري لسهل أربيل (EPAS) يدرس الاستيطان واستخدام الأراضي من العصر الحجري الجديد الى يومنا هذا في محافظة أربيل في كردستان العراق، والتي تشمل جزءا كبيرا من قلب الإمبراطورية الآشورية. فمن خلال خمسة مواسم من الدراسة الحقلية تم توثيق منطقة استيطان واسعة في إقليم بالغ الأهمية من الناحيتين الاجتماعية والسياسية، خصوصا خلال العصر البرونزي والحديدي، يضم 728 موقعا أثريا تقريبا.             تجمع طرق العمل الحقلي التجميع السطحي التقليدي واستخدام الصور الجوية التاريخية وصور عن طريق الأقمار الصناعية ونظم المعلومات الجغرافية المحمول mobile GIS والمسح التصويري الجوي بدون طيار UAV. وبينت النتائج الأولية أنماط غير متوقعة: مستوطنات كثيفة السكان لها ثقافة أوروك من الألف الرابع قبل الميلاد، وأشكال حضرية متباينة من العصر البرونزي: ومستوطنات كبيرة منخفضة الكثافة السكانية في نهاية العصر الساساني او بداية العصر الإسلامي. يختبر المشروع بشكل صريح عدة فرضيات حول التخطيط المركزي الآشوري للأراضي في قلب الإمبراطورية. ويبدو ان هذه الفرضيات قد تم إثباتها، ولو أن الظروف كانت أكثر تعقيدا مما كان الحال عليه في الأقاليم المجاورة، وقد يكون ذلك بسبب طول فترة الاستيطان المتواصل فيها.},

From the Late Uruk period to the end of the Old Babylonian period (c.3500 to 1500 BC), Mesopotamian cities contained all of the material manifestations of civilization that have fascinated archaeologists and epigraphers: palaces and temples with traditions of high art, administrative organization, and monumental architecture. These material remains gave clues to social and political institutions and their roles in maintaining urban society. The spatial scale of the settlement, on the other hand, reveals the extent to which these institutions successfully maintained social cohesion among the diverse kin and ethnic groups within the cities. In their absence, settlements inevitably split apart as disputes emerged that could not be resolved except via spatial distance between feuding parties. Such cycles of growth and fission in individual settlements had been ongoing since the start of sedentism in the Neolithic, until the fourth millennium BC.},

  abstract = {Burnt materials are very common in the archaeological record. Their identification and the reconstruction of their firing history are crucial for reliable archaeological interpretations. Commonly used methods are limited in their ability to identify and estimate heating temperatures below {\textasciitilde}500{$^0$}C and cannot reconstruct the orientation in which these materials were burnt. Stepwise thermal demagnetization is widely used in archaeomagnetism, but its use for identifying burnt materials and reconstructing paleotemperatures requires further experimental verification. Here we present an experimental test that has indicated that this method is useful for identifying the firing of mud bricks to 190{$^0$}C or higher. Application of the method to oriented samples also enables reconstruction of the position in which they cooled down. Our algorithm for interpreting thermal demagnetization results was tested on 49 miniature sun-dried ``mud bricks'', 46 of which were heated to a range of temperatures between 100{$^0$}C to 700{$^0$}C under a controlled magnetic field and three ``bricks'' which were not heated and used as a control group. The results enabled distinguishing between unheated material and material heated to at least 190{$^0$}C and accurately recovering the minimum heating temperature of the latter. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) on the same materials demonstrated how the two methods complement each other. We implemented the thermal demagnetization method on burnt materials from an Iron Age structure at Tell es-Safi/Gath (central Israel), which led to a revision of the previously published understanding of this archaeological context. We demonstrated that the conflagration occurred within the structure, and not only in its vicinity as previously suggested. We also showed that a previously published hypothesis that bricks were fired in a kiln prior to construction is very unlikely. Finally, we conclude that the destruction of the structure occurred in a single event and not in stages over several decades.},

We propose HyEnA, a hybrid (human + AI) method for extracting arguments from opinionated texts, combining the speed of automated processing with the understanding and reasoning capabilities of humans. We evaluate HyEnA on three feedback corpora. We find that, on the one hand, HyEnA achieves higher coverage and precision than a state-of-the-art automated method, when compared on a common set of diverse opinions, justifying the need for human insight. On the other hand, HyEnA requires less human effort and does not compromise quality compared to (fully manual) expert analysis, demonstrating the benefit of combining human and machine intelligence.},

In this article I study eight attestations in the Astronomical Diaries from Babylon of the Aramaic loanword madinatu: (KUR)ma-di-na-at (once URU mad-di-na-at, once KUR ma-di-na-t{\'u}). The Aramaic word in question is mdynh (mədin{\=a}) (status rectus) or mdynt' (mədint{\=a}) (status determinatus) and in the construct state mdynt (mədinat). The attestations are: AD 3, no. -143C: 7; no. -137A: 19; no. -137B: rev. 21'; no. -137C: rev. 17'; no. -130B: rev. 2'; no. -93A: rev. 11'; no. 93A: rev. 23; no. -86A: 10. There is one attestation in a Babylonian Chronicle of the Hellenistic period: BCHP 18C: 6'. The basic meaning of the Aramaic word is ``area of jurisdiction'', and then ``province'', ``satrapy'', ``district'' or ``land''. In later Aramaic the word can be used for ``city'' (with area of jurisdiction around; Greek polis). Jean-Marie Durand drew my attention to a much earlier attestation in Mari: (A.3082 = ARM XXVI no. 483 [http://www.archibab.fr/4DCGI/en/listestextes3.htm?WebUniqueID=1826838], lines 3-4). The meaning of madinatu in all Babylonian texts is ``province'', ``satrapy'', ``district'' or ``country'', e.g. used for Media and Elam. Nevertheless the ideographic rendering of the term is URU.ME{\v S}, literally ``cities'', as we see interchangably URU.ME{\v S} {\v s}{\'a} KUR Ma-da-a-a and madinat {\v s}a KUR Ma-da-a-a. This sheds new light on a famous passage in the diary of 169 BC, AD 2 -168A: 15, mAn LUGAL ina URUme{\v s} {\v s}{\'a} kurMe-luh-ha {\v s}al-{\d t}a-ni{\v s} GIN.GIN-a[k]). We should read here: ``Antiochus (IV) marched around victoriously in the land of Egypt'' (rather than ``in the cities of Egypt'').}

In turn, this has resulted in increased awareness of, and interest in, computational methods for automatic image analysis. Despite the tremendous progress made in the development of computational methods, there remains a gap between how a person interprets an image and what can be automatically extracted. By considering iconic images as those images for which this gap is most salient, as their meaning goes well beyond what is represented in the visual data, this article gives an overview of the potential and limitations of computational methods for iconic image analysis. I structure this overview by discussing methods that can be used to analyse the production, distribution, and reception of iconic images. Although the majority of computational methods focus on analysing production aspects, there are promising methods for image distribution aspects, whereas methods for studying image reception have received little attention. By considering the limitations of available methods I argue that computational methods can be of use for studying iconic images, but that comprehensive analysis will require methods that incorporate the plurality of meanings an image can have, and temporal nature thereof.},

This should allow us to reconsider the ontological status of digital text, and that will ground future work discussing the specific analytical affordances offered by digital texts understood as digital texts. Following from the argument of Suzanne Briet regarding documentation, referring to Eco's understanding of `infinite semiosis', and accounting for the reciprocal effects between carrier technology and meaning observed by McLuhan, we argue that the functions of document and text are realized primarily by their fluid nature and by the dynamic character of their interpretation. To define the purpose of textual scholarship as a `stabilisation' of text is therefore fallacious. The delusive focus on `stability' and discrete `philological fact' gives rise to a widespread belief in textual scholarship that digital texts can be treated simply as representations of print or manuscript texts. On the contrary---digital texts are texts in and of themselves in numerous digital models and data structures which may include, but is not limited to, text meant for graphical display on a screen. We conclude with the observation that philological treatment of these texts demands an adequate digital and/or computational literacy.},

The example of the several editions of Beethoven's 1st Symphony, which are all based on the same authentic source (printed parts) shows that aspects of the production and transmission process which help to understand editorial problems in general are more interesting than the edited texts. Similar problems appear in manuscripts and the broad availability of scanned sources brings out the question if, on the one hand, we will have to differentiate between graphemes which until now have been summed up under the same notion, and whereas on the other hand we perhaps often tend to be more sophisticated in terms of exactness than coevals. Thus the move to digital editions will promote questions about writing processes in general and will strengthen the role of contextual knowledge. At the same time this contributes to a clear shift of interest - the former `edited text' is no longer the main goal of a critical edition.},

However, much of the site remains unexplored, leaving many questions unanswered about the location of dense archaeological deposits, the nature of urban organization, and water management strategies---specifically those located in the eastern sector of the Akapana Pyramid. Orthophoto mosaics and Digital Elevation Models derived from drone imagery helped identify archaeological features and anthropogenic mounds. New magnetic survey produced with a cesium gradiometer was merged with previous surveys (fluxgate and cesium gradiometer). The integration of maps and plans from six areas of a previous archaeological investigation within a common Geographical Information System helped relate geophysical anomalies to archaeological features. Our results demonstrate a high level of urban organization associating monumental buildings to open ritual spaces and to densely populated areas during Tiwanaku IV (500--800\,CE) and V (800--1100\,CE). The complexity of the urban organization is also demonstrated by landscape modifications such as a complex water management system and at least three terraces that augmented the monumentality of the Akapana Pyramid This interdisciplinary approach, innovative in Bolivia, provides new insight into one of the most significant archaeological sites in the Andes.},

  abstract = {It is increasingly common in natural and social sciences to rely on network visualizations to explore relational datasets and illustrate findings. Such practices have been around long enough to prove that scholars find it useful to project networks in a two-dimensional space and to use their visual qualities as proxies for their topological features. Yet these practices remain based on intuition, and the foundations and limits of this type of exploration are still implicit. To fill this lack of formalization, this paper offers explicit documentation for the kind of visual network analysis encouraged by force-directed layouts. Using the example of a network of Jazz performers, band and record labels extracted from Wikipedia, the paper provides guidelines on how to make networks readable and how to interpret their visual features. It discusses how the inherent ambiguity of network visualizations can be exploited for exploratory data analysis. Acknowledging that vagueness is a feature of many relational datasets in the humanities and social sciences, the paper contends that visual ambiguity, if properly interpreted, can be an asset for the analysis. Finally, we propose two attempts to distinguish the ambiguity inherited from the represented phenomenon from the distortions coming from fitting a multidimensional object in a two-dimensional space. We discuss why these attempts are only partially successful, and we propose further steps towards a metric of spatialization quality.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an Application Programming Interface (API) for addressing music notation on the web regardless of the format in which it is stored. This API was created as a method for addressing and extracting specific portions of music notation published in machine-readable formats on the web. Music notation, like text, can be "addressed" in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds, thus raising such questions as how can one virtually "circle" some music notation? How can a machine interpret this "circling" to select and retrieve the relevant music notation? The API was evaluated by: 1) creating an implementation of the API for documents in the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format; and by 2) remodelling a dataset of music analysis statements from the Du Chemin: Lost Voices project (Haverford College) by using the API to connect the analytical statements with the portion of notaiton they refer to. Building this corpus has demonstrated that the Music Addressability API is capable of modelling complex analytical statements containing references to music notation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONTransport has long been viewed as of central importance to modern British economic history. More than forty years ago, Rostow (1960: 302) viewed the railway as the `leading sector' of the British economy of the mid-nineteenth century, driving broader economic modernisation through its strong intersectoral linkages. This early interest in the developmental role of transport has given way more recently to a closer understanding and recognition of its pioneering contribution to behavioural and structural elements of economic change, particularly in terms of government intervention and corporate innovation.This chapter will describe the process of transport growth in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and then focus more closely on its political, organisational and developmental impact. Transport systems (including communications) move people, goods and information. This chapter will look at each of these functions in order to reveal the pervasive role of the transport industry in modern British history. The tendencies for transport infrastructure to take the form of a public good, open to all users, and for some transport services to operate in a manner similar to a monopoly explain the interest shown in the industry by governments seeking to assess the private and public costs and benefits involved. The large size and capital-intensive nature of many operating units caused unprecedented organisational challenges for transport companies. The identification of transport as a form of social overhead capital, supporting production across the economy, helps account for its broad-ranging impact on economic development that has been the focus of much of the historiography.},

This 'industrious revolution' is the context in which the economic acceleration associated with the Industrial Revolution took shape. This study explores the intellectual understanding of the new importance of consumer goods as well as the actual consumer behavior of households of all income levels. De Vries examines how the activation and evolution of consumer demand shaped the course of economic development, situating consumer behavior in the context of the household economy. He considers the changing consumption goals of households from the seventeenth century to the present and analyzes how household decisions have mediated between macro-level economic growth and actual human betterment. Ultimately, de Vries' research reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing consumer theory, suggesting revisions that add historical realism to economic abstractions.},

Non-elite families negotiated different terms of marriage than elite families, in three areas: bridal wealth, household creation, and regulations about adultery and divorce. However, these divergent marriage practices became less pronounced and eventually obsolete in the course of the Persian period. This article first presents the evidence for the two marriage types and then seeks to find an answer, albeit a partial one, to the question why these traditions changed from c. 490 BCE onwards.},

This volume offers a practical introduction to the repertoire of personal names recorded in cuneiform texts from Babylonia in the first millennium BCE.

The multilingual nature of this name material poses challenges for students and researchers who want to access these data as part of their exploration of the social history of the region in the period. This volume offers guidelines and tools that will help readers navigate this difficult material. The title is also available Open Access on Cambridge Core.},

This material enables the authors to evaluate the nature of Xerxes' policies in the sphere of society, science, religion, law, administration and economy against the long-term history of the region.

We present a survey of HITL NLP work from both Machine Learning (ML) and Human-computer Interaction (HCI) communities that highlights its short yet inspiring history, and thoroughly summarize recent frameworks focusing on their tasks, goals, human interactions, and feedback learning methods.

  abstract = {Am?l-Marduk (561?560 BC), Neriglissar (559?556 BC), and Nabonidus (555?539 BC) were the last native kings of Babylon. In this modern scholarly edition of the complete extant corpus of royal inscriptions from each of their reigns, Frauke Weiersh{\"a}user and Jamie Novotny provide updated and reliable editions of the texts. The kings of the Neo-Babylonian Empire left hundreds of official inscriptions on objects such as clay cylinders, bricks, paving stones, vases, and stelae. These writings, ranging from lengthy narratives enumerating the deeds of a monarch to labels identifying a ruler as the builder of a given structure, supplement and inform our understanding of the empire. Beginning with a historical introduction to the reigns of these three kings and the corpus of inscriptions, Weiersh{\"a}user and Novotny then present each text with an introduction, a photograph of the inscribed object, the Akkadian text in a newly collated transliteration, an English translation, catalogue data, commentary, and an updated bibliography. Additionally, Weiersh{\"a}user and Novotny provide new translations of several related Akkadian texts and chronicles. Featuring meticulous yet readable transliterations and translations that have been carefully collated with the originals, this book will be the standard edition for scholars and students of Assyriology, the Neo-Babylonian dialect, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for decades to come.},

MELD usersand software agents create semantic annotations of musicconcepts and relationships, which are associated with mu-sical structure specified by the Music Encoding Initiativeschema (MEI). Annotations are expressed in RDF, allow-ing alternative music vocabularies (e.g., popular vs. clas-sical music structures) to be applied. The same underly-ing framework retrieves, distributes, and processes infor-mation that addresses semantically distinguishable musicelements. Further knowledge is incorporated from exter-nal sources through the use of Linked Data. The RDF isalso used to match annotation types and contexts to render-ing actions which display the annotations upon the digitalscore. Here, we present a MELD implementation and de-ployment which augments the digital music scores used bymusicians in a group performance, collaboratively chang-ing the sequence within and between pieces in a set list.},

Digital repositories provide access to publicly licensed score images, score encodings, textual resources, audiovisual recordings, and music metadata. While each repository reveals rich information for scholarly investigation, the unified exploration and analysis of separate digital collections remains a challenge. TROMPA---Towards Richer Online Music Public-domain Archives---addresses this through a knowledge graph interweaving composers, performers, and works described in established digital music libraries, facilitating discovery and combined access of complementary materials across collections. TROMPA provides for contribution of expert insights as citable, provenanced annotations, supporting analytical workflows and scholarly communication. Beyond scholars, the project targets four further user types: instrumental players; choir singers; orchestras; and music enthusiasts; with corresponding web applications providing specialised views of the same underlying knowledge graph. Thus, scholars' annotations provide contextual information to other types of users; while performers' rehearsal recordings and performative annotations, conductors' marked up scores, and enthusiasts' social discussions and listening behaviours, become available to scholarly analysis (per user consent). The knowledge graph is exposed as Linked Data, adhering to the FAIR principles of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable, and supporting further interlinking, re-interpretation and re-use beyond the immediate scope of the project.},

  abstract = {Floodplains represent a global hotspot of sensitive socioenvironmental changes and early human forcing mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the environmental conditions of preindustrial floodplains in Central Europe and the fluvial societies that operated there. Due to their high land-use capacity and the simultaneous necessity of land reclamation and risk minimisation, societies have radically restructured the Central European floodplains. According to the current scientific consensus, up to 95\% of Central European floodplains have been extensively restructured or destroyed. Therefore, question arises as to whether or when it is justified to understand Central European floodplains as a `Fluvial Anthroposphere'. The case studies available to date show that human-induced impacts on floodplain morphologies and environments and the formation of specific fluvial societies reveal fundamental changes in the medieval and preindustrial modern periods. We aim to contribute to disentangling the questions of when and why humans became a significant controlling factor in Central European floodplain formation, and how humans in interaction with natural processes and other chains of effects have modified floodplains. As a conclusion, we superimpose emerging fields of research concerning the onset of the Fluvial Anthroposphere and provide 10 specific thematic objectives for future multidisciplinary work.},

The text on many of these maps is also undeciphered and a number of examples are translated here for the first time, including an unpublished map of an irrigation network in the Sch{\o}yen Collection. By examining all this material in a single study, it becomes clear that there was a coherent documentary genre in Mesopotamia which was cartographic in nature, and which served a variety of administrative and planning purposes. The Near Eastern cartographic corpus is also contextualised within the wider history of cartography, so that its place in the global development of graphic mapping can be better understood.},

Here the older worlds of the Algonquians and of various Europeans overlapped, and their mixture created new systems of meaning and of exchange. Finally, the book tells of the breakdown of accommodation and common meanings and the re-creation of the Indians as alien and exotic.

  abstract = {Abstract             This article suggests ways scholars may be able to deploy digital techniques in contexts without readily available quantitative data. Using the Mapping Black London (MBL) project in World War II as a case study, the article proposes ways scholars can `reverse engineer' qualitative information in order to generate the data needed to make meaningful digital maps. The MBL project conducted a staged approach to digitally map the black presence in London during World War II. In contrast to other phased approaches where work typically begins with a lengthy stage of database construction and data entry followed by `traditional' analysis toward the end, MBL sought to minimize the lengthy and costly lead times common to many Historic Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) projects. Work progressed through three alternative stages where the MBL team `mapped the topic', before mapping selected aspects of the secondary literature and primary evidence. This article discusses the benefits drawn from such an approach, as well as suggesting some circumstances where similar methods might be deployed by others seeking to `reverse engineer' qualitative sources to create digital maps.},

The authors do this by using a cutting-edge computational method, which they apply to large collections of digitized texts. In particular, they demonstrate the affordances of a neural language model for historical research. In a deliberate maneuver, the authors use a type of model, often portrayed as sentient today, to detect figures of speech in nineteenth-century texts that portrayed machines as self-acting, automatic, or alive. Their masked language model detects unusual or surprising turns of phrase, which could not be discovered using simple keyword search. The authors collect and close read such sentences to explore how figurative language produced a context that conceived humans and machines as interchangeable in complicated ways. They conclude that, used judiciously, language models have the potential to open up new avenues of historical research.},

It posits for it a historical context based on a reaction to contemporary ancient Near Eastern intellectual currents. Specifically this centers on Babylonian divination, astrology in particular, whose recognition as a serious branch of scientific reasoning in the ancient world was undeniable---or so it seems. The Book of Esther, which, as this paper demonstrates, manifests an unmistakable familiarity with this divinatory lore, itself partakes in the broader conversation. But, in accordance with its overring theme, it comes down on the matter with a reverse verdict.}

This volume offers a different perspective: writing as shown here is, at its heart, a deeply social practice connecting narrative to the different categories of knowledge (linguistic, political, administrative, legal, historical and geographic) and literacy. The twelve essays investigate how scribal practices are related to the construction of knowledge and challenge the conventional boundaries. They address various types of knowledge whose potential is triggered by certain needs and values in the context of Antiquity, Late Antiquity and Medieval Islam from al-Andalus through Egypt, Syria to Iraq, Anatolia and Bactria as far afield as Ethiopia. The vast majority of the papers are related thematically and the overall connection between the articles is the salient feature of this volume. The papers also demonstrate how the local context has shaped scribal practices allowing for cross-cultural comparison},

  abstract = {The Luwian language belongs to the Anatolian group of the Indo-European language family and thus constitutes a close relative of Hittite. As a rule, the Luwian cuneiform passages represent incantations embedded in Hittite religious texts. Although their full corpus was published in the twentieth century, no attempts at their cohesive philological translation has been undertaken up to now. The volume Luwili: Hittite-Luwian ritual texts attributed to Puriyanni, Kuwattalla, and {\v S}ilalluḫi (CTH 758--763) represents the first step toward achieving this goal. Ilya Yakubovich and Alice Mouton, two Hittitologists specializing in Luwian Studies and Anatolian ritualistic traditions respectively, joined efforts in order to approach the Hittite-Luwian rituals from both linguistic and anthropological perspectives. The rituals that they have edited there contain more than fifty percent of the Luwian cuneiform corpus. Their research contributes to two different fields: first, it helps the scholarly community to understand better the Luwian language, second, it impacts the study of Anatolian religions. The authors attempted to avoid the technical jargon in as much as possible, while the layout of the edition, where the transliteration and translation are aligned with each other on two symmetrical pages, should facilitate its reading.},

Written by an international team of scholars in the fields of archaeology, epigraphy, and bioanthropology, the volume presents central debates around a range of archaeological issues, including gender, ritual, the creation of alphabets and early writing, biblical periods, archaeometallurgy, looting, and maritime trade. Collectively, the essays also engage diverse theoretical approaches to demonstrate the multi-vocal nature of studying the past.~Significantly, The Social Archaeology of the Levant updates and contextualizes major shifts in archaeological interpretation.},

However, certain measures taken by him are within the norms of ancient Near Eastern politics. In addition, accusations made against him by the author of the polemical pamphlet may be relativized. Nab{\^u}-{\v s}uma-i{\v s}kun's actions in the international sphere prove that he was a far-sighted statesman. It is demonstrated that important religious and political objectives of this king were not fundamentally different from those of later Babylonian rulers, including kings of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.}

Without doubt, just as today, one of the important sources of income was widespread rental of houses in the large cities, which, except in periods of crisis, gave a fairly stable income. (Renting of houses in the countryside was in Mesopotamia rare, because clay - main building material - was commonly available and building a small house was cheap and easy). This observation is supported by the fact that in the extant documents no known example refers to a legal dispute about unpaid rent, although cases of novation are known. Despite the importance of the rental of private houses the question has never been the subject of a comprehensive study. Only occasionally has it been discussed by editors of documents, in a synthesis, or in a chapter (or part of it) on family archives},

  abstract = {Public transportation systems (PTSs) play an important role in modern cities, providing shared/massive transportation services that are essential for the general public. However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.},

  abstract = {Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.},

The new method shifts the focus of the measurement of text difficulty from language units and grammatical complexity to combinations of language units, which breaks the limitations of existent methods of the measurement of Chinese texts' difficulty. First, the effectiveness of the two-character continuations in the differentiation of texts difficulties is verified. Second, for the application of the `i\,+\,1' model in measuring text difficulty, the pedagogy and language acquisition theories are analyzed to check its rationality. Third, a corpus of two-character continuations is built up, with which the empirical values of `1' for two-character continuations with various difficulty levels in the `i\,+\,1' measurement model are obtained. Subsequently, the testing texts, the two-character continuations corpus, and the empirical values of `1' are integrated to test the validity of the `i\,+\,1' model in the measurement of text difficulty. The research shows that, compared to those methods based on the complex features of language, the `i\,+\,1' measurement model based on two-character continuations, with fewer indicators and more convenience in the measurement, demonstrates better measurement result of text difficulty.},
